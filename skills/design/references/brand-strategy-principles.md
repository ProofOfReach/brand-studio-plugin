# Brand Strategy Principles Reference

## What Is a Brand? (Neumeier)

> "A brand is a person's gut feeling about a product, service, or company."

Key insights:
- It's not what YOU say it is—it's what THEY say it is
- Brands exist in minds, not in marketing departments
- Trust is the foundation of all brand value

## The Brand Gap

The "brand gap" is the gulf between:
- **Business strategy** (what you plan)
- **Customer experience** (what they feel)

Bridging requires connecting **logic** (left brain) with **magic** (right brain).

## The 5 Disciplines (Neumeier)

### 1. Differentiate
> "When everybody zigs, zag."

- Be number one or two in your category, or redefine the category
- Competition forces specialization
- Survival of the fittingest, not just fittest
- Differentiation evolved: What it is → What it does → How you'll feel → Who you are

**The 3 Questions:**
1. Who are you?
2. What do you do?
3. Why does it matter?

### 2. Collaborate
> "It takes a village to build a brand."

- Brands result from thousands of people over time
- Like building a cathedral—many craftsmen, shared vision
- Shift from "ownership" to "partnership"
- Prototypes beat presentations

### 3. Innovate
> "How do you know when an idea is innovative? When it scares the hell out of everybody."

- Design, not strategy, ignites passion
- MAYA principle: Most Advanced Yet Acceptable
- Our distrust of creativity comes from the Enlightenment's worship of logic
- Yet logic rarely convinces anyone of anything important

### 4. Validate
- Transform communication from monologue to dialogue
- Get feedback before committing
- Focus groups FOCUS research, they don't BE the research
- Test for: Distinctiveness, Relevance, Memorability, Extendibility, Depth

### 5. Cultivate
> "Brands are living, breathing things."

- Business is a process, not an entity
- Alignment, not rigid consistency
- Every person in the company is an actor in the brand story
- Pass out the compasses—everyone needs brand intuition

## Brand Ideals (Wheeler)

### Vision
A compelling vision by a passionate leader is the foundation. Great brands start with someone who sees what others can't.

### Meaning
> "People don't buy what you do; they buy why you do it." — Simon Sinek

The best brands stand for something:
- A big idea
- A strategic position
- A defined set of values
- A voice that stands apart

### Authenticity
> "Authenticity is doing what you promise, not 'being who you are.'" — Seth Godin

Survey finding: 75% of branding professionals say authenticity is most important for future branding.

### Coherence
Every touchpoint should feel like the same company:
- Unified voice
- Consistent look and feel
- Same quality level everywhere

### Flexibility
Brands must be agile:
- Support evolving strategy
- Work across media and scale
- Anticipate future needs

### Differentiation
> "In order to be irreplaceable, one must always be different." — Coco Chanel

Brands compete for attention, loyalty, and money. Being good isn't enough—be distinctive.

### Longevity
- Brands are messengers of trust
- Durability = commitment to core idea over time
- Evolution, not revolution (Morton Salt Girl: 100+ years, still recognizable)

## Messaging Principles (Wheeler)

### Voice = Personality
> "Voice is the verbal expression of the brand's personality"

- Consistent across all channels
- Distinctive and memorable
- Vital, straightforward, eloquent, substantive

### The Power of Three
People can comprehend only three messages at once:
- One umbrella message
- Supported by three subordinate messages
- Based on risk communication theory (Dr. Vincent Covello)

### Writing Fundamentals
> "Vigorous writing is concise. A sentence should contain no unnecessary words, a paragraph no unnecessary sentences." — Strunk & White

- Clarity, brevity, precision
- Edit ruthlessly—less is more
- Use language that resonates with meaning

> "A charismatic brand is any product, service, or company for which people believe there's no substitute."

Characteristics:
- High customer loyalty
- Premium pricing power
- Tribe-like following
- Clear point of view

## Brand Positioning Statement Template

**For** [target audience]
**Who** [statement of need/opportunity]
**[Brand name] is a** [category]
**That** [key benefit/reason to believe]
**Unlike** [competitors]
**Our brand** [key differentiator]

## Strategy Questions Checklist

Before visual design:
1. Who is the target audience?
2. What do they currently think/feel about this category?
3. What do we want them to think/feel?
4. What is the single most important message?
5. What proof supports this message?
6. What is the brand's personality/voice?
7. What action should the audience take?
8. How will we measure success?
