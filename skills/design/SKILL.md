# Design Skill

## 1. Overview

This skill provides comprehensive visual design capabilities for brand identity creation, from initial concept development through final asset delivery. It integrates with AI image generation tools (nano-banana MCP) to produce professional visual assets while following established design principles and brand strategy frameworks.

### Core Capabilities

**Logo Design**: Create distinctive, memorable marks that communicate brand essence through symbol, wordmark, or combination approaches.

**Color Palette Development**: Build cohesive color systems grounded in color theory, psychology, and practical application across digital and print media.

**Typography Selection**: Choose and pair typefaces that reinforce brand personality while ensuring readability and versatility.

**Visual Identity Systems**: Develop comprehensive visual languages that unify all brand touchpoints through consistent design elements.

### Adaptive Workflow

The skill adjusts depth and approach based on:
- **Project scope**: A social media avatar requires different treatment than a complete brand identity system
- **Brand maturity**: Startups need foundational identity; established brands may need refinement or evolution
- **Application context**: Digital-first brands have different requirements than print-heavy applications
- **User expertise**: Provide more foundational context for beginners, more advanced techniques for experienced designers

## 2. The Design Process

Follow these five stages sequentially. Rushing to visual execution before completing discovery undermines the strategic foundation that distinguishes effective design from decoration.

### Stage 1: Discovery

Before creating any visual work, gather intelligence on three fronts:

**Brand Foundation Research**
- What are the core values and mission of the brand?
- What is the brand personality (if a person, how would they speak, dress, behave)?
- What is the unique value proposition or differentiator?
- What story does the brand need to tell?

**Audience Research**
- Who is the primary audience? Demographics, psychographics, aspirations?
- What visual languages resonate with this audience?
- What design conventions does this audience expect (and which can be challenged)?
- Where will they encounter the brand visually?

**Competitive Landscape Analysis**
- What visual approaches dominate the category?
- Where is there visual white space for differentiation?
- Which competitors have strong/weak visual identities and why?
- What category cliches should be avoided or subverted?

**Application Audit**
- What are all the touchpoints where the brand will appear?
- What are the technical constraints (size requirements, color limitations, file formats)?
- What is the hierarchy of importance among applications?
- Are there specific industry or regulatory requirements?

### Stage 2: Concept Development

Translate discovery insights into visual directions through structured ideation:

**Mind Mapping**
- Map associations from brand values to visual metaphors
- Explore semantic connections (what does "innovation" look like? "trust"? "warmth"?)
- Identify unexpected connections that could differentiate

**Concept Articulation**
- Develop 3-5 distinct conceptual directions, each with:
  - Core visual idea or metaphor
  - Emotional tone and personality
  - Key differentiating attributes
  - Rough color and typography direction

**Moodboard Development**
- Curate reference imagery for each direction
- Include typography samples, color references, texture/pattern inspiration
- Show range within each direction (subtle to bold expressions)

**Direction Selection Criteria**
- Strategic alignment with brand positioning
- Differentiation from competitive set
- Versatility across required applications
- Longevity potential (avoids trend-dependent elements)
- Feasibility within project constraints

### Stage 3: Visual Exploration

Execute visual development across the core identity elements:

**Logo Concepts**
- Generate multiple approaches within chosen direction(s)
- Explore symbol/icon, wordmark, and combination options
- Test at extreme scales (favicon to billboard)
- Consider animation and motion potential
- Verify uniqueness against existing marks

**Color Palette Development**
- Establish primary, secondary, and accent color relationships
- Build color scales with tints and shades for flexibility
- Test accessibility (WCAG contrast requirements)
- Verify color harmony using established theory (complementary, analogous, triadic)
- Create specifications for digital (RGB, HEX) and print (CMYK, Pantone)

**Typography System**
- Select primary typeface for headlines/display use
- Choose complementary typeface for body text
- Establish type scale and hierarchy
- Define weights, styles, and usage rules
- Test legibility across sizes and contexts

**Supporting Elements**
- Develop patterns, textures, or graphic devices
- Create iconography style if needed
- Establish photography/illustration direction
- Define spatial and compositional principles

### Stage 4: Refinement

Test and iterate visual elements through rigorous evaluation:

**Technical Testing**
- Verify scalability across all required sizes
- Test color reproduction across media
- Check legibility in all contexts
- Validate file integrity and format specifications

**Context Testing**
- Mock up in real-world applications
- Test against competitive context
- Evaluate in intended environments (screen, print, signage)
- Gather stakeholder feedback at key checkpoints

**Iteration Principles**
- Preserve what is working; refine what is not
- Document rationale for changes
- Maintain multiple viable options until final selection
- Test variations against clear criteria, not subjective preference

**Common Refinement Areas**
- Logo balance and optical adjustments
- Color fine-tuning for harmony and accessibility
- Typography kerning, tracking, and hierarchy refinement
- Element proportion and spacing optimization

### Stage 5: Delivery

Package final assets with comprehensive documentation:

**Primary Deliverables**
- Logo files in all required formats (vector, raster, various color modes)
- Color palette specifications (HEX, RGB, CMYK, Pantone)
- Typography files or font licensing information
- Supporting graphic elements and patterns

**Brand Guidelines Document**
- Logo usage rules (clear space, minimum size, incorrect uses)
- Color specifications and usage hierarchy
- Typography specifications and hierarchy
- Layout principles and grid systems
- Application examples (letterhead, business card, social, etc.)
- Do's and don'ts with visual examples

**Asset Organization**
- Clear file naming conventions
- Organized folder structure
- Version control documentation
- Source files for future editing

## 3. Core Principles

These foundational principles inform all design decisions:

### From Logo Design Principles
- **Simplicity**: The most enduring logos reduce to essential forms; complexity obscures recognition
- **Memorability**: Distinctive shapes and ideas stick; generic approaches fade
- **Versatility**: Effective marks work across all sizes, media, and contexts
- **Appropriateness**: The visual treatment must align with brand positioning and audience expectations
- **Timelessness**: Resist trends that will date the mark; seek enduring form

### From Color Theory Principles
- **Harmony**: Colors in relationship create emotional response; disharmony creates dissonance
- **Contrast**: Sufficient contrast ensures functionality and draws attention
- **Psychology**: Colors carry cultural and psychological associations that influence perception
- **Context**: Color meaning shifts with application; the same hue reads differently in different contexts
- **Consistency**: Color builds recognition through repetition; variation must be intentional

### From Typography Principles
- **Hierarchy**: Visual weight and scale guide the reader through information
- **Legibility**: The primary purpose of type is to be read; never sacrifice clarity for style
- **Personality**: Typefaces carry character; selection communicates before a word is read
- **Pairing**: Contrast creates interest; harmony creates cohesion; both are needed
- **Restraint**: Limit typefaces to maintain cohesion; two families typically suffice

### From Brand Strategy Principles
- **Positioning**: Visual identity must reinforce strategic position; design follows strategy
- **Differentiation**: Looking like the category means competing on price; distinction creates value
- **Consistency**: Recognition builds through repetition; variation dilutes brand equity
- **Evolution**: Brands grow and change; identity systems must accommodate evolution
- **Authenticity**: Visual identity must be true to brand substance; decoration without foundation fails

## 7. Implementation Notes

When executing this skill:

1. **Never skip discovery**: Even for simple tasks, confirm brand context and objectives before designing
2. **Strategy before aesthetics**: Visual decisions must serve strategic intent
3. **Generate multiple options**: Initial exploration should be broad; narrow through evaluation
4. **Explain design rationale**: Transparency about choices builds trust and educates the user
5. **Test in context**: Always evaluate design in real-world application, not isolation
6. **Invite iteration**: Good design emerges through refinement; welcome feedback and revision
7. **Maintain design integrity**: Advocate for solutions that serve long-term brand equity, not just immediate preferences

The goal is visual identity that differentiates, resonates, and endures. Every technique, principle, and tool exists to serve that outcome.
