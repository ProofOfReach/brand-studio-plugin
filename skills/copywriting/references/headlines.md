### USEFUL
Does it promise a benefit the reader actually wants?
- 4 = Solves a burning problem or grants a deep desire
- 3 = Clear practical benefit
- 2 = Vague or implied benefit
- 1 = No benefit, feature-only

### URGENT
Does it compel immediate action?
- 4 = Time-sensitive, scarcity, or consequence for delay
- 3 = Implies timeliness or momentum
- 2 = Could act anytime
- 1 = No urgency whatsoever

### UNIQUE
Does it stand apart from competitors?
- 4 = Never seen before, proprietary mechanism
- 3 = Fresh angle on known topic
- 2 = Slightly different phrasing
- 1 = Generic, interchangeable

### ULTRA-SPECIFIC
Does it use concrete details?
- 4 = Exact numbers, names, measurable outcomes
- 3 = Specific category or timeframe
- 2 = General descriptors
- 1 = Vague abstractions

**Scoring:** 12-16 = Excellent | 9-11 = Good | 6-8 = Needs work | Below 6 = Rewrite

## WIEBE: 7 SECRETS OF ATTENTION-GRABBING HEADLINES

### SECRET 1: MAKE AN ALMOST UNBELIEVABLE PROMISE
Walk the line between believable and snake-oil. Keep visitors slightly suspicious, but intrigued.

- "How to Build a Memory in 4 Short Weeks---So Powerful It Is Beyond Your Wildest Dreams Today!"
- "This book could remove your fear of death forever"

### SECRET 2: GIVE A TIME LIMIT
Hours, days, maybe weeks. Not months or years. Tap the get-rich-quick psychology.

- "Change Your Life by Next Week"
- "Hollywood plastic surgeon releases 7-day crash course for new youth and beauty"

### SECRET 3: STOMP JUST 1 OBJECTION TO SMITHEREENS
Address either the most common major objection OR the most curious major/minor objection.

| Objection | Headline |
|-----------|----------|
| Yoga's too hard---it's only for flexible people | Is This the World's Easiest Yoga? |
| This is probably snake-oil BS | "When I Was Able to Rattle Off 20 Digits of Pi, I Knew This Memory Course Was Worth Every Penny..." |

### SECRET 4: BE UNEXPECTED
Use unexpected analogies, unusual questions, seemingly unrelated statements.

**Boring:** "Now Doing Your Taxes Is Easier Than Ever"
**Unexpected:** "What If Doing Your Taxes Felt As Indulgent As Licking Icing Off A Birthday Cake?"

**Intriguing words:** Mysteriously, Curious, Unlikely, Arrogant, Wunderkind, Pure, Fat-Destroyer, Startling, Explosive, Astronomical, Little-known, Violent

### SECRET 5: TAP INTO SOMETHING VISCERAL
Deeper than happiness, joy, sadness, anger. Human and powerful:
- Greed
- Lust
- Pride
- Power
- Revenge

- "Is It Immoral to Make Money This Easily?"
- "Why Models Stay Young Till Sixty!"

### SECRET 6: USE TRIGGER WORDS
**Secret** - "The more secret something claims to be, the more intriguing it is"
**Curious** - Implies discovery and insider knowledge
**Free** - Still the most powerful word in advertising
**You** - Makes it personal and immediate

### SECRET 7: QUOTE SOMEONE ELSE
Third-party claims are more credible than first-party claims.
- Put testimonials in quotation marks as headlines
- Quotation marks catch the eye and signal human interaction
- Headlines in quotes increase recall by 28%

## WIEBE: 4 EVIL FORMULAS (Avoid These)

### EVIL FORMULA 1: THE FUTURE
"The future of X is here"

### EVIL FORMULA 2: WELCOME TO
"Welcome to" + anything
"Welcome to the next generation of" + anything
- Passive, customer-focused on you not them

### EVIL FORMULA 3: THE "JUST GOT"
Noun + "just got" + adjective
- "Creating videos just got better"
- Vague, no specificity, lazy writing

### EVIL FORMULA 4: THE MISPLACED TAGLINE
Word. Word. Word.
- "Play. Laugh. Achieve."
- Taglines are not headlines

## THE NANA RULE (Wiebe)

> "If I learned that my sweet, wonderful nana had purchased something with this headline, would I worry that she'd been ripped off?"

## OGILVY: LONG-HEADLINE RESEARCH FINDINGS

### Key Research Insights

1. **5x Rule**: On average, 5x as many people read headlines as body copy. Once you've written your headline, you've spent 80 cents of your dollar.

2. **Headlines with benefits promise** outperform all others---whiter wash, more miles per gallon, freedom from pimples.

3. **News headlines** are recalled by 22% more people than headlines without news. Use: announcing, introducing, now, suddenly.

4. **Information headlines** attract above-average readership: "How to Win Friends and Influence People"

5. **Include the brand name** in your headline. 80% of readers who don't read body copy will never know what you're advertising otherwise.

6. **Flag your audience** if selling to a specific group: asthma, bedwetters, women over 35.

7. **Length paradox**: Headlines with 10+ words get less readership in general. BUT retail ads with 10+ word headlines sell more merchandise. **If you need long, go long.**
