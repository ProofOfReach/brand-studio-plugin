# Leads: The Complete Framework for Lead Generation & Copy

A lead is the critical bridge between your headline and body copy. It transforms curiosity into commitment, turning a casual glance into deep engagement. This reference synthesizes proven frameworks from Kyle Milligan, Eugene Schwartz, Drew Eric Whitman, and Alex Hormozi.

In the broader context of marketing, "leads" also refers to potential customers who have shown interest in your product or service. This document covers both meanings: **lead copy** (the opening of your sales message) and **lead generation** (acquiring potential customers).

## Part I: Lead Copy Frameworks

## The 5 Lead Requirements (Milligan)

Every effective lead must accomplish these five tasks:

### 1. Capture Attention
Use a **Pattern Interrupt** - show something unexpected that stops the reader cold.

```
WEAK: "Dear Reader, I want to tell you about..."
STRONG: "See this document I'm holding in my hand?"
STRONG: "Do you see the tiny device in this photo?"
STRONG: "Look at this chart. Something strange happened in March..."
```

**Pattern Interrupt Techniques:**
- Physical object reference ("See this...")
- Unusual visual ("Notice anything strange about...")
- Provocative statement ("Everything you've been told is wrong...")
- Breaking the fourth wall ("Before I begin, I need to warn you...")

### 2. Expand Upon the Headline
Deliver a "payoff" - give readers slightly more detail without revealing secrets.

```
HEADLINE: "Tiny, Incredible Gadget Could Bring $15 Trillion..."

EXPANSION:
"A gadget you could conceal in the palm of your hand...
That could easily pass through airport security...
And could be mass-produced quickly...
Holds the technology set to blow the lid off a $15 trillion tech revolution..."
```

**Expansion Formula:**
- List 2-3 intriguing properties
- Build visual imagery
- Hint at the magnitude without revealing the mechanism

### 3. Establish Credibility
Drop authority proof early - one powerful line is enough.

```
EXAMPLES:
"I'm Robert Kiyosaki, author of Rich Dad Poor Dad, the #1 best-selling personal finance book of all time."

"Joe Schneider, managing director at KPMG Corporate Finance, said, 'Once the massive market disruption begins... we expect significant turmoil.'"

"According to Forbes, this technology 'will reshape every industry on Earth.'"
```

### 4. Make the Big Promise
State your core benefit using the Big 4 Emotions (New, Easy, Safe, Big).

```
TEMPLATE: "[Minimal effort] + [Specific benefit] + [Speed/Frequency]"

EXAMPLE:
"All it takes is a couple of these secrets to start collecting anywhere from $1,168, $2,551, and even $4,377 in safe and predictable cash flow week in and week out..."

BREAKDOWN:
- "All it takes" = EASY
- "$1,168, $2,551, $4,377" = ULTRA-SPECIFIC + BIG
- "safe and predictable" = SAFE
- "week in and week out" = FAST/RECURRING
```

### 5. Open a Loop (The Bribe)
Create an incomplete thought that compels continued reading.

```
OPEN LOOP TEMPLATES:
"In just a moment, I'll show you exactly how [claim] is possible..."
"Stick with me, and I'll prove beyond a shadow of a doubt..."
"But first, there's something you need to understand..."
"The secret lies in what happens next..."
"On page 7, I'll reveal the exact mechanism..."
```

## The Big 4 Emotions (Milligan)

Weave these throughout your lead - they are the language of copywriting:

| Emotion | Alter Ego | Power Words |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| **NEW** | Only | Breakthrough, Revolutionary, Discovery, First-ever, Announcing |
| **EASY** | Anybody | Simple, Push-button, Step-by-step, Automatic, All you do is... |
| **SAFE** | Predictable | Proven, Guaranteed, History repeats, 93% certainty, Again and again |
| **BIG** | Fast | Huge, Monster, Once-in-a-lifetime, Overnight, In just 7 days |

**The NESB Formula:**
- **N**ew = Hope (This could finally be the solution)
- **E**asy = Confidence (Anyone can do this)
- **S**afe = Trust (The outcome is predictable)
- **B**ig = Excitement (The reward justifies attention)

---

## Lead Strategies by Awareness Level (Schwartz)

Match your lead approach to how aware your prospect is:

### Level 1: Most Aware
*They know your product and want it - just haven't bought yet.*

**Strategy:** Lead with product name + offer
```
"Revere Zomar Lens, Electric Eye Camera - Formerly $149.50 - Now Only $119.95"
```

### Level 2: Product Aware
*They know the product but aren't convinced.*

**Strategy:** Lead with superiority claim
```
"At 60 miles an hour, the loudest noise in a Rolls Royce is the electric clock."
```

**7 Tasks for Product-Aware Leads:**
1. Reinforce desire for the product
2. Sharpen the image of satisfaction
3. Extend where/when it works
4. Introduce new proof
5. Announce a new mechanism
6. Eliminate former limitations
7. Reposition against competition

### Level 3: Solution Aware
*They want what it does but don't know your product exists.*

**Strategy:** Lead with desire crystallization + proof
```
"Who else wants a whiter wash - with no hard work?"
"When DOCTORS feel rotten - this is what THEY do."
```

### Level 4: Problem Aware
*They recognize a need but don't know solutions exist.*

**Strategy:** Lead with problem dramatization
```
"Corns?"
"Do YOU make these mistakes in English?"
"Shrinks hemorrhoids without surgery."
```

### Level 5: Completely Unaware
*They don't know they have a problem.*

**Strategy:** Lead with identification, story, or hidden desire

```
"THEY LAUGHED WHEN I SAT DOWN AT THE PIANO - BUT WHEN I STARTED TO PLAY!..."

"WHY MEN CRACK..."

"OFTEN A BRIDESMAID BUT NEVER A BRIDE"
```

**Rules for Unaware Markets:**
- DO NOT mention price
- DO NOT feature product name prominently
- DO NOT make direct claims
- DO call your market together through identification
- DO use story, emotion, and indirect approaches

## 12 Ways to Lure Readers Into Your Copy (Whitman)

Transition techniques from headline to body copy:

### 1. Continue the Thought
```
HEADLINE: "Psychologist's Study Reveals Speaking Patterns That Put Rude Salespeople in Their Place"
LEAD: "You know the rude salespeople we mean. The ones with the big mouths who don't understand the word no..."
```

### 2. Ask a Question
```
"How would you handle yourself in a sticky situation like this?"
```

### 3. Quote a Respected Authority

```

### 5. Challenge Them to Prove It Works

"Here's what we want you to do. Read pages 8 and 9 of this book - no more. Then go to the dealership with the reputation for the most obnoxious..."
```

### 6. Start With Skepticism
```
"When we first received the manuscript from the author, we were skeptical. But some of us in the editorial office actually tried some of these tricks, and we were absolutely blown away."
```

### 7. Tell What Others Are Saying (Bandwagon)
```
"'Nobody hates obnoxious salespeople more than I do. So when I first saw the ad for this book I thought it was too good to be true. It is, in fact, the most powerful book I've ever read...' - Bob Manstreth, Philadelphia, PA"
```

### 8. Play Reporter
```
"Philadelphia, PA - A New York psychologist has just released the findings of a seven-year study that explains how any man or woman can use the power of a new communication psychology to..."
```

### 9. Get Personal With You
```
"Have YOU ever been hassled by a salesperson who can't take no for an answer? Do YOU hate when people push you around and manipulate you? Would YOU like to know a powerful new way to instantly put these people in their place?"
```

### 10. Tell a Dramatic Story
```
"It was 3 AM when the phone rang. My wife looked at me, terrified. 'Who could be calling at this hour?' Little did we know, this call would change everything..."
```

### 11. Give Super-Detailed Specs
```
"This amazing new book - a hefty 8 1/2 x 11-inch leather-bound, hardcover beauty - is jam-packed with over 327 pages, 10 information-filled chapters, and 45 of the most effective communication tools ever developed..."
```

### 12. Use a Very Short First Sentence
```
"Don't you hate it?"
"It's so annoying!"
"It makes me sick."
"I can't stand it!"
```

## 8 Lead Types with Templates

### 1. The Story Lead
*Best for: Unaware markets, complex products, emotional purchases*

```
TEMPLATE:
[Relatable character] + [Familiar situation] + [Unexpected turn] + [Hint of solution]

EXAMPLE:
"Arthur had just played 'The Rosary.' The room rang with applause. I decided that this would be a dramatic moment for me to make my debut. To the amazement of all my friends, I strode confidently over to the piano and sat down.

'Jack is up to his old tricks,' somebody chuckled. The crowd laughed...

Then I Started to Play.

Instantly a tense silence fell on the guests..."
```

### 2. The Problem-Agitate Lead
*Best for: Problem-aware markets, pain-point products*

```
TEMPLATE:
[Name the problem] + [Dramatize the pain] + [Amplify consequences] + [Hint at solution]

EXAMPLE:
"You know them. Strong men. Vigorous men. Robust men - men who have never had a sick day in their lives. They drive. They drive themselves to the limit. They lash themselves OVER the limit with stimulants.

They crack. Often, they crash.

You have seen them afterwards. Pitiful shells. The zest gone, the fire gone. Burnt-out furnaces of energy.

But what if there was a way to reclaim that vitality without the crash?"
```

### 3. The Secret Lead
*Best for: Solution-aware markets, information products*

```
TEMPLATE:
[Establish exclusive knowledge] + [Hint at insider access] + [Promise revelation]

EXAMPLE:
"See this document I'm holding in my hand?

It's called The Pre-IPO Prospectus.

It's the ONLY document in the world that contains details of a pre-IPO strategy that could help you make a fortune from this private company's explosive growth...

BEFORE it goes public!

In the next few minutes, I'll show you exactly how to get your hands on one..."
```

### 4. The Proclamation Lead
*Best for: Product-aware markets, bold claims*

```
TEMPLATE:
[Bold statement] + [Immediate proof] + [Stakes]

EXAMPLE:
"America's #1 Stock Analyst is DONE with stocks.

After 30 years of picking winners... after generating $2.3 billion in documented gains for his readers... after being named 'Analyst of the Decade' by Forbes...

He's walking away. Here's why - and what he's doing instead..."
```

### 5. The Prediction Lead
*Best for: Trend-based products, financial markets*

```
TEMPLATE:
[State the prediction] + [Historical parallel] + [Specific timeline] + [Stakes]

EXAMPLE:
"I'm reaching out to you today with a HUGE profit opportunity the likes of which has only been seen twice in history...

And the last time was more than a century ago.

$3.1 trillion is about to change hands. And if you position yourself correctly in the next 30 days, you could capture your share..."
```

### 6. The Quiz/Question Lead
*Best for: Engaging skeptics, qualifying readers*

```
TEMPLATE:
[Provocative question] + [Self-identification] + [Promise of answer]

EXAMPLE:
"Do YOU make these mistakes in English?

Most people do - without even knowing it. These errors cost them jobs, respect, and opportunities every single day.

Take this 60-second quiz to find out if you're sabotaging yourself... and what to do about it."
```

### 7. The Offer Lead
*Best for: Most aware markets, transactional copy*

```
TEMPLATE:
[Product] + [Irresistible terms] + [Urgency]

EXAMPLE:
"Announcing: The Complete WordPress Masterclass - 47 video lessons, 12 downloadable templates, and lifetime access to our private community...

Normally $997. This week only: $197.

But only 100 spots available at this price. Here's why..."
```

### 8. The Contrarian Lead
*Best for: Sophisticated markets, differentiation*

```
TEMPLATE:
[Challenge conventional wisdom] + [New mechanism] + [Proof it works]

EXAMPLE:
"Everything you've been told about weight loss is wrong.

Counting calories doesn't work. Here's proof: 95% of dieters regain all the weight within 2 years.

But what if the problem isn't willpower - it's biology? A Stanford researcher has discovered a 'metabolic switch' that explains why some people stay thin effortlessly while others struggle..."
```

## The Slippery Slide Concept

Your lead should create unstoppable momentum. Every sentence should compel reading the next.

**The Slide Mechanics:**

1. **Short opening sentence** - Easy entry point
2. **Incomplete thoughts** - Create forward motion
3. **Curiosity gaps** - Promise payoffs ahead
4. **Varied rhythm** - Mix sentence lengths
5. **Cliffhangers** - End sections with hooks

```
EXAMPLE:
"Don't you hate it?    [SHORT - entry point]

That feeling when you know you're being ripped off... but you can't prove it.    [EMOTION - resonance]

Well, I have proof.    [SHORT - pivot]

Exposed in the next 3 pages is the biggest financial scandal of the decade. The mainstream media won't touch it. The government pretends it doesn't exist. But the evidence is undeniable.    [BUILD - stakes]

And here's the crazy part...    [CLIFFHANGER - open loop]

The same forces behind this scandal have accidentally created a $2.3 trillion opportunity. An opportunity that could put an extra $4,700 in your pocket every single month.    [PROMISE - benefit]

Let me explain...    [BRIDGE - momentum]"
```

## Quick Reference: Lead Formulas

**The AIDA Lead:**
Attention + Interest + Desire + Action-toward-reading-more

**The PAS Lead:**
Problem + Agitation + Solution-hint

**The 4 U's for Headlines that Feed Leads:**
Urgent + Unique + Useful + Ultra-specific

**The Soul Test:**
Can you summarize your entire message in one sentence? If not, your lead lacks focus.

*Example: "Trump did a thing, now you get paid."*

## Part II: Lead Generation Frameworks (Hormozi)

## The Core Four Advertising Methods

There are only four ways to let people know about your stuff. Everything else is a variation of these:

### The Core Four Matrix

| Method | Audience | Communication | Cost |
|--------|----------|---------------|------|
| **Warm Outreach** | People who know you | One-to-one | Free (time) |
| **Post Free Content** | Followers/Subscribers | One-to-many | Free (time) |
| **Cold Outreach** | Strangers | One-to-one | Free (time) |
| **Run Paid Ads** | Strangers | One-to-many | Money |

### 1. Warm Outreach
*Contact people who already know you*

**Definition:** Reaching out to friends, family, past colleagues, social media connections, or anyone who would recognize your name.

**The A-C-A Framework (Acknowledge-Compliment-Ask):**

```
TEMPLATE:
"Hey [Name], I saw [something specific about them]. [Genuine compliment about it].
I'm working on [your thing] and thought of you. Would you be open to [specific ask]?"

EXAMPLE:
"Hey Sarah, I saw your post about finally hitting your Q4 targets. Crushing it as always!
I just launched a new [service/product] and thought you might know someone who'd benefit.
Would you be open to a quick call to hear about it? Even if it's not for you, you might know someone."
```

**Warm Outreach Best Practices:**
- Reach out to 100 people in your first week
- Personalize every message (no copy/paste)
- Don't pitch in the first message - ask permission
- Offer value even if they're not interested
- Ask for referrals, not just sales
- Follow up 2-3 times (most sales happen on follow-up)

**The Warm Outreach Sequence:**
1. Initial reach out (A-C-A)
2. Wait 48 hours
3. Follow up with additional value
4. Wait 72 hours
5. Final follow up ("Just checking in before I close the loop")

### 2. Post Free Content
*One-to-many communication with people who follow you*

**Definition:** Creating content that provides value to your audience at scale. This includes social media posts, blog articles, podcasts, videos, newsletters, and any content that can be consumed by many people simultaneously.

**The Hook-Retain-Reward Framework:**

Every piece of content needs three elements:

```
HOOK (First 3 seconds)
- Pattern interrupt
- Curiosity gap
- Bold claim
- Question

RETAIN (Middle)
- Deliver promised value
- Use open loops throughout
- Vary pacing and format
- Build toward payoff

REWARD (End)
- Deliver satisfying conclusion
- Exceed expectations
- Create desire for more
- Clear call to action
```

**7 Headline Components for Content:**

| Component | Definition | Example |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| **Recency** | Something new/timely | "Just discovered...", "Breaking..." |
| **Relevancy** | Matters to your audience | "For [specific avatar]...", "If you [do X]..." |
| **Celebrity** | Known person/brand | "What Elon Musk taught me...", "The Apple approach to..." |
| **Proximity** | Close to reader's experience | "In your city...", "People like you..." |
| **Conflict** | Tension/controversy | "Why I disagree with...", "The lie about..." |
| **Unusual** | Surprising/unexpected | "The weird reason...", "Counterintuitive truth..." |
| **Ongoing** | Continuing story/update | "Month 6 of...", "The latest on..." |

**The Give:Ask Ratio:**

For every ask you make, provide at least 3.5 gives.

```
FORMULA: Minimum 3.5 value pieces : 1 ask

EXAMPLE CONTENT CALENDAR:
Monday: Value post (Give)
Tuesday: Value post (Give)
Wednesday: Value post (Give)
Thursday: Value post (Give)
Friday: Soft pitch (Ask)
Saturday: Value post (Give)
Sunday: Value post (Give)
```

**Types of Value Content:**
- Educational (How to...)
- Inspirational (Transformation stories)
- Entertaining (Personality-driven)
- Controversial (Strong opinions)
- Behind-the-scenes (Process/journey)

### 3. Cold Outreach
*Contact strangers one-to-one*

**Definition:** Reaching out to people who don't know you via email, DM, phone, or any direct communication channel.

**The Cold Outreach Framework:**

```
STEP 1: Build Your List
- Define ideal customer profile (ICP)
- Source contacts (LinkedIn, databases, scraping)
- Verify contact information
- Segment by relevance

STEP 2: Personalize + Big Fast Value
- Research each prospect
- Lead with insight, not pitch
- Offer immediate, tangible value
- Make responding easy

STEP 3: Volume
- Contact 100+ prospects per day minimum
- Track response rates
- Iterate on messaging
- Follow up systematically
```

**Cold Outreach Message Structure:**

```
TEMPLATE:
Line 1: Personalized hook (proves you did research)
Line 2: Credibility/relevance (why you're reaching out)
Line 3: Big Fast Value (what's in it for them)
Line 4: Soft CTA (easy next step)

EXAMPLE:
"Hey Marcus - saw your post about struggling with [specific problem].

I've helped 47 [similar companies] solve that exact issue.

Just put together a quick breakdown of the 3 things that worked best -
happy to send it over if you're interested?

No pitch, just thought it might help."
```

**The Personalization Hierarchy:**
1. **Highest:** Reference specific content they created
2. **High:** Reference their company's recent news/changes
3. **Medium:** Reference their role/industry challenges
4. **Low:** Reference their company/industry generically
5. **Lowest:** Generic template (avoid this)

**Volume Expectations:**
- 100 cold emails/day = 10-20 responses = 2-5 conversations = 1 customer
- Improve your offer to improve these ratios
- Better targeting = better response rates

### 4. Run Paid Ads
*Pay to reach strangers at scale*

**Definition:** Paying platforms (Facebook, Google, YouTube, LinkedIn, etc.) to show your message to targeted audiences.

**Paid Ads Call-Out Types:**

The first job of any ad is to call out your target audience. Four ways to do this:

| Call-Out Type | Description | Example |
|---------------|-------------|---------|
| **Labels** | Directly name the audience | "Attention business owners...", "For coaches only..." |
| **Yes-Questions** | Questions they'd answer yes to | "Tired of [problem]?", "Want [result]?" |
| **If-Then** | Conditional statements | "If you've tried [X] and it didn't work...", "If you're a [type] who wants [result]..." |
| **Ridiculous Results** | Extreme/specific outcomes | "How I made $427,391 in 90 days selling...", "From 0 to 10K followers in 30 days" |

**The What-Who-When Framework:**

Create ad variations by combining:

```
WHAT (The Result)
- Financial outcome
- Time saved
- Status gained
- Problem solved
- Pain avoided

WHO (The Avatar)
- Demographic
- Psychographic
- Situational
- Aspirational

WHEN (The Timeline)
- Specific timeframe
- Life stage
- Event-triggered
- Seasonal
```

**48+ Combinations Example:**
- What: "Make an extra $5K/month"
- Who: "Stay-at-home parents"
- When: "In the next 90 days"
= "Stay-at-home parents: Make an extra $5K/month in the next 90 days"

**LTGP:CAC Ratio (Lifetime Gross Profit to Customer Acquisition Cost):**

```
TARGET RATIO: 3:1 minimum

FORMULA:
LTGP = (Average Order Value x Gross Margin x Purchase Frequency x Customer Lifespan)
CAC = Total Advertising Spend / Number of Customers Acquired

EXAMPLE:
LTGP = $500 x 0.7 x 4 x 3 = $4,200
CAC = $10,000 / 10 = $1,000
Ratio = $4,200 / $1,000 = 4.2:1 (healthy)

INTERPRETATION:
- Below 1:1 = Losing money on every customer
- 1:1 to 2:1 = Marginal/risky
- 2:1 to 3:1 = Acceptable, optimize
- 3:1+ = Healthy, scale
- 5:1+ = Very profitable, scale aggressively
```

## Lead Magnets

A lead magnet is something you offer for free in exchange for contact information. The goal: Provide enough value that prospects want to continue the relationship.

### The 7 Types of Lead Magnets

| Type | Description | Best For | Example |
|------|-------------|----------|---------|
| **1. Reveal Problems** | Diagnose/audit | High-ticket services | "Free website audit reveals 7 conversion killers" |
| **2. Samples/Trials** | Try before buying | Software, subscriptions | "14-day free trial", "First chapter free" |
| **3. One Step of Multi-Step** | First step of bigger process | Courses, programs | "Free lesson 1 of my 7-part system" |
| **4. Software/Tools** | Useful tool/calculator | Tech, finance | "Free ROI calculator", "Free Chrome extension" |
| **5. Communities** | Access to a group | B2B, professionals | "Free Facebook group for [niche]" |
| **6. Physical Products** | Tangible free items | E-commerce | "Free book (just pay shipping)" |
| **7. Services** | Free work/consultation | Service businesses | "Free 30-min strategy session" |

### Lead Magnet Creation Formula

**Step 1: Solve a Narrow Problem Completely**

```
BAD: "Free guide to marketing" (too broad, can't deliver complete solution)
GOOD: "Free template: The exact email that books 10 sales calls per week" (narrow, complete)

NARROW = Specific audience + Specific problem + Specific outcome
```

**Step 2: Reveal the Next Problem**

The best lead magnets solve one problem and naturally reveal a bigger one that your paid product solves.

```
EXAMPLE:
Lead Magnet: "How to write headlines that get 3x more clicks"
Reveals: They now need help with the rest of the sales page
Paid Product: Complete copywriting course
```

**Step 3: Create High Perceived Value**

Perceived value comes from:
- Professional presentation
- Specific, quantified outcomes
- Name recognition/authority
- Scarcity/exclusivity
- Length/depth (when appropriate)

### The Lead Magnet Naming Formula

**Formula: [Avatar] + [Goal] + [Timeframe] + [Container]**

```
COMPONENTS:
Avatar: Who is this for? (Specific as possible)
Goal: What will they achieve/learn/get?
Timeframe: How quickly? (Creates urgency)
Container: What format is it? (Checklist, template, training, etc.)

EXAMPLES:
"The [SaaS Founder's] Guide to [Hitting $1M ARR] in [12 Months]: The Complete [Blueprint]"
"[Real Estate Agents]: [Double Your Listings] in [90 Days] with This [Free Training]"
"[E-commerce Owners]: The [5-Page Checklist] to [6-Figure Black Friday] in [30 Days]"
```

### Lead Magnet Quality Checklist

- [ ] Does it solve a real, painful problem?
- [ ] Is the problem narrow enough to solve completely?
- [ ] Does it naturally lead to your paid offer?
- [ ] Would they pay $10-$100 for this?
- [ ] Is the name compelling (Avatar + Goal + Timeframe + Container)?
- [ ] Can it be consumed in under 30 minutes?
- [ ] Does it provide an immediate quick win?
- [ ] Is it better than competitors' paid products?

## Content Structure Deep Dive

### The Hook-Retain-Reward Framework (Expanded)

**HOOK (0-3 seconds) - Purpose: Stop the scroll**

```
HOOK TEMPLATES:

Pattern Interrupt:
- "Stop scrolling. This will change how you think about [topic]."
- "I shouldn't be telling you this, but..."
- "Delete that app. Here's why."

Curiosity Gap:
- "The real reason [surprising claim]..."
- "What [successful person] won't tell you about [topic]..."
- "I made $[X] doing something everyone says not to do."

Bold Claim:
- "[Controversial statement]."
- "Everything you know about [topic] is wrong."
- "[Number]% of [audience] fail because of this one thing."

Question:
- "Why do [successful people] do [unexpected thing]?"
- "What would you do with an extra [specific benefit]?"
- "Have you ever wondered why [curious observation]?"
```

**RETAIN (3 seconds to end-30 seconds) - Purpose: Keep them watching/reading**

```
RETAIN TECHNIQUES:

Open Loops:
- "The third one surprised me the most..." (list items)
- "But that's not even the interesting part..."
- "I'll reveal exactly how at the end..."

Pacing Variation:
- Short sentence. Then longer explanatory sentence that adds context.
- List of three.
- Question to re-engage?

Proof Stacking:
- Personal story/results
- Student/customer results
- Third-party validation
- Logic/data

Value Delivery:
- Actually teach something useful
- Be specific (numbers, steps, examples)
- Make it actionable
```

**REWARD (Final moments) - Purpose: Satisfy and prompt action**

```
REWARD STRUCTURE:

Deliver the Payoff:
- Complete the promise from the hook
- Exceed expectations when possible
- Leave them better than you found them

Create Desire for More:
- "This is just one of the [X] strategies in my [program]..."
- "If you found this helpful, I go deeper on..."
- "Comment [keyword] and I'll send you..."

Clear CTA:
- Single, specific action
- Low friction
- Relevant to content
```

### Content Pillars Strategy

Build your content around 3-5 core themes that:
1. Demonstrate your expertise
2. Attract your ideal customer
3. Naturally lead to your offer

```
EXAMPLE (Fitness Coach):
Pillar 1: Nutrition myths debunked
Pillar 2: Home workout techniques
Pillar 3: Mindset/motivation
Pillar 4: Client transformation stories
Pillar 5: Day-in-the-life content
```

## The Rule of 100

The minimum effective dose for any advertising method.

### Rule of 100 by Method

| Method | Rule of 100 | Timeframe |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| **Warm Outreach** | 100 reach-outs | Per week |
| **Content** | 100 minutes creating | Per day |
| **Cold Outreach** | 100 reach-outs | Per day |
| **Paid Ads** | $100 ad spend | Per day |

### Why 100 Works

```
MATH:
- 100 attempts = enough data to see patterns
- 100 attempts = at least some successes (even with low conversion)
- 100 attempts = proof of commitment
- 100 attempts = forced iteration and improvement

EXAMPLE (Cold Outreach):
100 emails/day x 5 days = 500 emails/week
500 emails x 2% response rate = 10 responses
10 responses x 30% conversion = 3 calls
3 calls x 33% close rate = 1 customer

Do this for 4 weeks = 4 customers
```

### Rule of 100 Progression

```
MONTH 1: Establish the habit
- Pick ONE method
- Hit 100 every single day/week
- Track everything

MONTH 2: Optimize
- Review what's working
- Double down on winners
- Cut losers

MONTH 3: Scale or Add

## The More-Better-New Framework

When scaling isn't working, diagnose with this framework (in order):

### 1. MORE of What's Working

```
QUESTION: Can you simply do more of what's already working?

BEFORE trying anything else:
- More volume (more calls, more content, more ads)
- More time (longer sessions, more days)
- More resources (more people doing the same thing)

EXAMPLE:
Warm outreach getting 10% response rate?
Don't try cold outreach yet - do MORE warm outreach.
100/week -> 200/week -> 500/week
```

### 2. BETTER Execution

```
QUESTION: Can you improve how you're doing what's working?

AFTER maxing out volume, improve:
- Better targeting (more qualified leads)
- Better messaging (higher response rates)
- Better timing (when you reach out)
- Better follow-up (more touches, better sequences)
- Better offer (more compelling)

EXAMPLE:
At maximum volume but only 5% response rate?
Test new subject lines, personalization, offers.
5% -> 10% -> 15% = 3x results without more volume.
```

### 3. NEW Methods

```
QUESTION: Only after maxing MORE and BETTER - should you try something new?

NEW means:
- New advertising method (add cold outreach to warm)
- New platform (add LinkedIn to email)
- New market segment
- New offer type

WARNING:
Most people jump to NEW too early.
They have shiny object syndrome.
NEW has a learning curve. MORE and BETTER don't.
```

### More-Better-New Decision Tree

```
Q1: Are you doing the Rule of 100?
    NO -> Do MORE first
    YES -> Q2

Q2: Have you optimized your conversion rates?
    NO -> Do BETTER first
    YES -> Q3

Q3: Are you at maximum capacity for current method?
    NO -> Do MORE first
    YES -> Now try something NEW
```

## Referral Systems

The most profitable advertising: Getting customers to bring you more customers.

### The Referral Growth Equation

```
FORMULA:
Referral Growth = (Customers) x (Referral Rate) x (Referral Value)

WHERE:
Customers = Number of active customers who could refer
Referral Rate = % who actually refer (and how many referrals each)
Referral Value = Value of each referral (conversion rate x customer value)

EXAMPLE:
1,000 customers x 10% referral rate x 2 referrals each x 50% conversion x $500 value
= 1,000 x 0.10 x 2 x 0.50 x $500 = $50,000 in referral revenue
```

### 7 Ways to Ask for Referrals

**1. The Direct Ask**
```
"You mentioned you're happy with [result]. Do you know anyone else who could benefit from the same thing?"
WHEN: Immediately after delivering value/results
```

**2. The Specific Ask**
```
"Who do you know that [specific characteristic]? I'm looking to help more [exact avatar type]."
WHEN: When you have a clear ideal customer profile
```

**3. The Incentivized Ask**
```
"For every person you refer who becomes a customer, I'll give you [reward]. And they'll get [bonus] too."
WHEN: Setting up a formal referral program
```

**4. The Social Proof Ask**
```
"I'm putting together case studies of success stories. Would you be willing to share yours? And if you know others who'd want similar results..."
WHEN: After documenting customer success
```

**5. The Reciprocity Ask**
```
"I'd love to refer business your way too. What does your ideal customer look like? And while we're at it, here's what mine looks like..."
WHEN: With B2B customers or referral partners
```

**6. The Exit Ask**
```
"Even though we're wrapping up, I'd love to stay in touch. If you come across anyone who could use help with [problem], please send them my way."
WHEN: At the end of an engagement
```

**7. The Referral-Only Ask**
```
"I only take new clients by referral. [Customer name] mentioned you might be interested. Is that right?"
WHEN: Positioning yourself as exclusive/premium (when you have enough referrals)
```

### Building a Referral System

**Step 1: Make Referrals Easy**
```
- Provide templates they can forward
- Create shareable content
- Give them a simple link
- Handle all the follow-up
```

**Step 2: Make Referrals Rewarding**
```
- Cash rewards ($50-$500 per referral)
- Discounts on future purchases
- Exclusive access/products
- Recognition/status
- Reciprocal referrals
```

**Step 3: Make Referrals Systematic**
```
- Ask at specific touchpoints (onboarding, results, renewal)
- Track referral sources
- Measure referral quality
- Optimize the ask
```

### Referral Program Template
