## The Seven Sweeps: Deep Dive

### Philosophy

Good copy editing isn't about rewriting—it's about enhancing. The Seven Sweeps framework catches issues that get missed when you try to fix everything at once. Each sweep focuses on one dimension, then loops back to verify previous improvements remain intact.

**Why sequential passes work:**
- Your brain can only optimize for one thing at a time
- Fixing tone might break clarity; checking after prevents cascading problems
- Each pass builds on the previous, creating a stronger foundation
- The loop-back mechanism catches unintended consequences

---

## Sweep 1: Clarity (Full Guide)

**The Question:** Can the reader understand what you're saying?

### Red Flags to Catch

1. **Overloaded sentences**
   - Multiple ideas crammed together
   - More than 3 conjunctions (and, but, or, so)
   - Sentences over 25 words

2. **Pronoun ambiguity**
   - "It" without clear reference
   - "They" when multiple groups mentioned
   - "This" pointing to unclear concept

3. **Jargon creep**
   - Industry terms without context
   - Acronyms not spelled out
   - Technical language when plain words work

4. **Buried leads**
   - Main point at end of paragraph
   - Qualifications before the claim
   - "In other words" needed to clarify

### Clarity Fixes

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| "We provide solutions that help facilitate better outcomes for your business operations" | "We help your business run better" |
| "It's important to note that..." | Delete. Just state the thing. |
| "What this means is that..." | Delete. Show, don't explain. |
| Long sentence with 4+ ideas | Split into 2-3 sentences |

### Clarity Rules

- **Rule of One**: One main idea per section
- **You Rule**: Copy speaks to "you," not about "customers"
- **Specificity Rule**: Concrete beats abstract every time
- **Grandmother Rule**: If she wouldn't understand it, simplify

---

## Sweep 2: Voice and Tone (Full Guide)

**The Question:** Is the copy consistent in how it sounds?

### Common Voice Breaks

1. **Formal ↔ Casual shifts**
   ```
   BAD: "Our innovative solutions help you achieve optimal results. Super easy to use!"
   GOOD: "Our tools help you get better results. And they're ridiculously easy to use."
   ```

2. **Company perspective shifts**
   - Mixing "we" and "the company"
   - Switching between first and third person
   - "Our team" → "the support team" mid-page

3. **Accidental tone changes**
   - Playful headline, dry body copy
   - Serious problem section, flippant CTA
   - Professional testimonials, casual FAQ

### Voice Consistency Checklist

- [ ] Same formality level throughout
- [ ] Consistent first/second/third person
- [ ] Humor (or lack thereof) maintained
- [ ] Technical depth appropriate and consistent
- [ ] Brand personality recognizable in every section

### The Read-Aloud Test

Read the copy out loud. Mark every place where:
- You stumble over words
- The rhythm feels off
- You'd naturally pause that isn't punctuated
- The "speaker" seems to change personality

---

## Sweep 3: So What (Full Guide)

**The Question:** Does every claim answer "why should I care?"

### The So What Test

After every statement, literally ask "So what?" If the copy doesn't answer:

```
CLAIM: "Our platform uses AI-powered analytics"
SO WHAT? "...so you can spot patterns humans miss"
SO WHAT? "...which means you catch problems before they cost you money"
```

Keep asking until you hit the real benefit.

### Feature → Benefit Bridges

Use these connectors to force the benefit:
- "...which means..."
- "...so you can..."
- "...that way, you..."
- "...resulting in..."
- "...leading to..."

### Common So What Failures

| Statement | Problem | Fix |
|-----------|---------|-----|
| "Built with React" | Only developers care | "Lightning-fast interface that never slows you down" |
| "24/7 availability" | So what? | "Get help the moment you need it, not during business hours" |
| "Award-winning design" | Whose award? Why care? | "Interface so intuitive, new users are productive in 5 minutes" |
| "Founded in 2015" | Irrelevant to reader | Cut it, or: "8 years of refinement means fewer bugs" |

### Benefits Hierarchy

Move up this ladder with each "so what?":
1. **Feature** → What it does
2. **Advantage** → Why that matters
3. **Benefit** → What changes for them
4. **Transformation** → Who they become

---

## Sweep 4: Prove It (Full Guide)

**The Question:** Is every claim supported with evidence?

### Proof Types (Strongest → Weakest)

1. **Third-party validation**: Awards, certifications, press mentions
2. **Specific testimonials**: Name, company, role, specific result
3. **Case studies**: Named company, situation, measurable outcome
4. **Statistics**: Sourced numbers, specific percentages
5. **Social proof numbers**: "Join 10,000+ teams"
6. **Guarantees**: Money-back, performance promises
7. **Demonstrations**: Screenshots, videos, live demos
8. **Authority**: Credentials, experience, expert endorsements

### Proof Gap Analysis

For each claim, ask:
- Can this be proven? If not, soften or cut.
- Is the proof nearby? If not, add it.
- Is the proof specific? Vague proof is no proof.
- Is the proof believable? Too-good claims need stronger proof.

### Claims That Always Need Proof

| Claim Type | Proof Required |
|------------|----------------|
| "Best" or "Leading" | Third-party ranking or data |
| ROI/savings claims | Case study or calculation |
| Time savings | Specific examples |
| "Trusted by" | Named logos or numbers |
| "Customers love" | Testimonial with name |
| Performance claims | Test results or benchmarks |

### Softening Unproven Claims

If you can't prove it, soften it:
- "The best" → "A powerful"
- "Everyone uses" → "Many teams use"
- "Guaranteed results" → "Designed to deliver"

Or better: find the proof.

## Sweep 5: Specificity (Full Guide)

**The Question:** Is the copy concrete enough to be compelling?

### Specificity Upgrades

| Vague | Specific |
|-------|----------|
| "Save time" | "Save 4 hours every week" |
| "Many customers" | "2,847 teams" |
| "Fast results" | "Results in 14 days" |
| "Affordable" | "Starting at $29/month" |
| "Great support" | "Response within 2 hours" |
| "Easy to use" | "Set up in 5 minutes, no training needed" |
| "Improve performance" | "37% faster load times" |
| "Trusted company" | "Serving 500+ customers since 2018" |

### The Concreteness Test

For each sentence, ask:
- Could a competitor say this exact thing?
- Does this paint a picture?
- Could I photograph or measure this?
- Is there a number that could go here?

If yes to the first or no to the others, make it more specific.

### Numbers That Convince

- **Odd numbers** feel more researched (37% beats 40%)
- **Precise numbers** feel more real ($47 beats "about $50")
- **Comparative numbers** show contrast ("3x faster")
- **Time-bounded numbers** add urgency ("in 30 days")

### Vague Word Hit List

Cut or replace:
- Streamline, optimize, enhance, leverage
- Revolutionary, innovative, cutting-edge
- Various, multiple, several, many
- Quality, value, excellence
- Solutions, synergies, ecosystem

---

## Sweep 6: Heightened Emotion (Full Guide)

**The Question:** Does the copy make the reader feel something?

### Emotional Triggers

| Emotion | How to Evoke |
|---------|--------------|
| **Pain** | Describe the frustrating "before" state vividly |
| **Relief** | Contrast with the easy "after" state |
| **Fear** | Show what happens if they don't act |
| **Pride** | Position them as smart for choosing this |
| **Belonging** | Show others like them succeeding |
| **Hope** | Paint the transformation they want |

### Sensory Language

Replace abstract with sensory:
- "More productive" → "Inbox at zero before lunch"
- "Better results" → "Watch your numbers climb"
- "Easier workflow" → "No more late nights fixing spreadsheets"

### Micro-Stories

Tiny narratives that create emotional connection:
- "Remember the last time you..."
- "Picture this: It's Monday morning and..."
- "You know that sinking feeling when..."

### The Emotion Gut Check

Read the copy and ask:
- Did I feel anything?
- Where did I feel it most?
- Where did I feel nothing?
- Would this move someone on the fence?

### Emotion Without Manipulation

Rules for authentic emotional copy:
- Never fabricate stories or testimonials
- Amplify real pain; don't invent it
- Promise only what you can deliver
- Respect the reader's intelligence

## Sweep 7: Zero Risk (Full Guide)

**The Question:** Have we removed every barrier to action?

### Risk Audit Near CTAs

For each CTA, list every possible hesitation:
- What if it doesn't work?
- What if I can't figure it out?
- What if it costs more than expected?
- What will others think?
- Is my information safe?
- What happens after I click?

### Risk Reducers

| Risk | Reducer |
|------|---------|
| Financial | Money-back guarantee, free trial |
| Time | "Setup in 5 minutes" |
| Complexity | "No technical skills required" |
| Social | Testimonials from similar people |
| Privacy | "We never share your data" |
| Commitment | "Cancel anytime" |
| Unknown | "Here's exactly what happens next" |

### Trust Signals Placement

Place these within visual proximity of CTAs:
- Security badges
- Testimonial quote
- "Join X others" social proof
- Guarantee language
- "No credit card required"
- Privacy assurance

### CTA Clarity Checklist

- [ ] Button text tells them what they get (not what they do)
- [ ] Expectations are set for what happens next
- [ ] Form fields are minimized
- [ ] Error states are helpful, not scary
- [ ] Progress indicators on multi-step forms
- [ ] Confirmation message is clear
