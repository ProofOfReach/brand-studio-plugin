## Part 1: The 5 Stages of Customer Awareness

Customer awareness determines how much your prospect knows about your product and the desire it satisfies. The more aware your market, the easier the selling job and the less you need to say.

Your headline's job is to meet prospects at their current awareness level and lead them toward your product.

---

### Stage 1: Most Aware

**Definition:** The customer knows your product, knows what it does, and knows they want it. They just haven't purchased yet.

**What They Know:**
- Your product name and brand
- Exactly what it does
- That they want it

**Headline Strategy:**
- State the product name prominently
- Lead with price, discount, or special offer
- Emphasize convenience: availability, delivery, proximity

**Headline Examples:**
- "Revere Zomar Lens, Electric Eye Camera - Formerly $149.50 - Now Only $119.95"
- "[Product Name] - 40% Off This Weekend Only"
- "Free Shipping on [Product] - Order by Friday"

**Copy Approach:**
- Brief summary of most desirable selling points
- Store name or coupon
- Quick close

**Diagnosis Questions:**
- Has the prospect seen extensive advertising for your specific product?
- Are they searching for your brand name?
- Is the main barrier simply price or convenience?

---

### Stage 2: Product Aware

**Definition:** The prospect knows of your product but doesn't yet want it. They're not completely convinced of what it does, how well it does it, or how much better it performs now.

**What They Know:**
- Your product exists
- It addresses their desire
- General category benefits

**What They Don't Know:**
- Why YOUR product is superior
- Latest improvements or mechanisms
- Full proof and documentation

**Headline Strategy - Seven Tasks:**

1. **Reinforce desire** through association, example, or sensory sharpening:
   - "Steinway - The Instrument of the Immortals"
   - "Which Twin Has the Toni?"
   - "The Skin You Love to Touch"

2. **Sharpen the image** of how product satisfies desire:
   - "At 60 miles an hour, the loudest noise in a Rolls Royce is the electric clock"
   - "The amazing story of a Zippo that worked after being taken from the belly of a fish"

3. **Extend usage** to new situations or times:
   - "Anywhere you go, Hertz is always nearby"
   - "Thirst knows no season" (Coca-Cola winter campaign)

4. **Introduce new proof**, details, or documentation:
   - "9 out of 10 screen stars use Lux Toilet Soap"
   - "In Boston, the #1 tea-drinking city, the #1 tea is Salada"

5. **Announce new mechanism** for better satisfaction:
   - "Hoover's new invention washes floors and vacuums up the scrub water"
   - "World's only dog food that makes its own gravy"

6. **Announce mechanism eliminating limitations:**
   - "You breathe no dusty odors when you do it with Lewyt"
   - "A new Zenith hearing aid - inconspicuous beyond belief"

7. **Completely change image** to escape competition (leads to Sophistication strategies)

**Copy Approach:**
- Display product name in headline or prominent logo
- Use headline to point out superiority
- Body elaborates with visualization, documentation, mechanization

**Diagnosis Questions:**
- Does the prospect recognize your brand?
- Have they seen your advertising before?
- Is the issue belief/conviction rather than awareness?

---

### Stage 3: Solution Aware

**Definition:** The prospect knows they want what the product does, but doesn't know that a product (specifically yours) exists to do it.

**What They Know:**
- They have a desire or want a result
- Solutions might exist somewhere

**What They Don't Know:**
- Your product exists
- That your product can deliver the solution

**Headline Strategy:**
- Name the desire and/or solution in the headline
- Prove the solution is achievable
- Show that your product contains the mechanism

**Key Attributes Needed:**
1. **Analysis** - Define the market, its awareness level, and driving emotional forces
2. **Intuition** - Sense trends, gauge force and direction, determine when it becomes profitable
3. **Verbal Creativity** - Name the undefined, capture feelings, create catchwords, focus emotion

**Headline Examples:**
- "Light a Lucky, and you'll never miss sweets that make you fat"
- "Who else wants a whiter wash - with no hard work?"
- "How to win friends and influence people"
- "To men who want to quit work some day"
- "When doctors feel rotten - this is what they do"
- "Now! Run your car without spark plugs!"
- "Who ever heard of 17,000 blooms from a single plant?"

**Copy Approach:**
- Crystallize the amorphous desire sharply and dramatically
- Prove the solution is achievable
- Connect solution mechanism to your specific product

**Diagnosis Questions:**
- Is the prospect actively looking for solutions?
- Do they know what type of product could help?
- Would they recognize your product category?

---

### Stage 4: Problem Aware

**Definition:** The prospect has a need (not a desire). They recognize the need but don't realize the connection between solving it and your product.

**What They Know:**
- They have a problem
- The problem is painful or bothersome

**What They Don't Know:**
- Solutions exist
- Your product solves it

**Headline Strategy:**
- Name the need and/or solution in headline
- Dramatize the need so vividly they realize how badly they need the solution
- Present your product as the inevitable answer

**Headline Types (Problem to Solution Spectrum):**

**Problem only:**
- "Corns?"

**Problem + Solution:**
- "Stops maddening itch"

**Remove limitations:**
- "Lets portable transistor radios play on ordinary household current"

**Problem + Solution + Limitation removal:**
- "Shrinks hemorrhoids without surgery"

**Substitution for unpleasant tasks:**
- "Now! A ring and piston job in a tube!"

**Prevention of future problems:**
- "Look, Mom! No cavities!"

**Emotional sharpening:**
- "Do YOU make these mistakes in English?"

**Verbal twist for freshness:**
- "How a bald-headed barber helped save my hair"

**Copy Approach:**
- Dramatize the problem vividly
- Agitate consequences of not solving
- Present your product as the obvious solution

**Diagnosis Questions:**
- Can the prospect articulate their problem?
- Are they actively seeking solutions?
- Do they know solutions are available?

---

### Stage 5: Completely Unaware

**Definition:** The prospect is either not aware of their desire/need, won't admit it to themselves, or the need is so amorphous it resists verbalization.

**What They Know:**
- Nothing specific about the problem
- Nothing about solutions
- Nothing about your product

**Challenges:**
- Outer reach of the awareness scale
- Prospects are hundreds of miles (psychologically) from accepting your product
- Direct statements of price, product, or function will not work

**What NOT to Do:**
1. Don't mention price - meaningless to someone who doesn't want the product
2. Don't feature product name - unknown or potentially negative associations
3. Don't make direct claims - they won't be believed or wanted

**What TO Do:**
Focus on the MARKET, not the product. Write an identification headline that:
- Calls your market together
- Echoes an emotion, attitude, or dissatisfaction
- Defines them for themselves
- Sells only the remainder of the ad (next paragraph)

**Headline Strategy Patterns:**

1. **Give words to a hidden dream:**
   - "THE UNIVERSITY OF THE NIGHT" (correspondence courses)

2. **Exploit a hidden fear:**
   - "WHY MEN CRACK..." (Postum coffee substitute)

3. **Start with universally accepted image, lead to unacceptable problem:**
   - "WITHIN THE CURVE OF A WOMAN'S ARM" (deodorant)

4. **Project hidden desire that can't be stated bluntly:**
   - The Marlboro Tattoo Ads (virility through imagery alone)

5. **Use common resentment to capture larger market:**
   - "WHY HAVEN'T TV OWNERS BEEN TOLD THESE FACTS" (TV repair book)

6. **Project ultimate triumph for identification:**
   - "THEY LAUGHED WHEN I SAT DOWN AT THE PIANO. BUT WHEN I STARTED TO PLAY!--"

7. **Project result of problem (not the problem itself):**
   - "OFTEN A BRIDESMAID BUT NEVER A BRIDE" (Listerine)

8. **Project accomplishment result to avoid implying work:**
   - "HERE'S AN EXTRA $50, GRACE - I'm making real money now!" (correspondence courses)

**Copy Approach:**
- Build steady progression of logical images
- Lead from identification through problem awareness
- Build to realization that solution is at hand
- Focus desire and solution onto your product

**Critical Rule:**
Your prospect must IDENTIFY with your headline before they can buy from it. It must be THEIR headline, THEIR problem, THEIR state of mind. It must pick out logical prospects AND reject as many people as it attracts.

**Diagnosis Questions:**
- Would a direct claim be rejected or ignored?
- Is the desire hidden, embarrassing, or unacknowledged?
- Has the market been exhausted by previous advertising?
- Is the product "old-fashioned" or out of public acceptance?

## Part 2: The 5 Stages of Market Sophistication

Market sophistication measures how many similar products and claims your prospect has already been exposed to. Each stage requires a different headline strategy.

---

### Sophistication Stage 1: First in Market

**Market Condition:** You are first with your particular product. Prospects have never received information about such a product before.

**Prospect Behavior:**
- More likely to become enthusiastic
- Will believe more of what you say
- Will buy more readily
- Your story is brand new to them

**How This Happens:**
- Technological breakthrough (new product category)
- Radically better product
- Familiar product at explosive new price
- Product applied to entirely different market
- New medium reaches untapped audience
- Discovery of unnoticed product performance

**Headline Strategy:**
BE SIMPLE. BE DIRECT. DON'T BE FANCY.
- Name either the need or the claim - nothing more
- Dramatize the claim powerfully
- Bring in product and prove it works

**Example:**
- "NOW! LOSE UGLY FAT!"

---

### Sophistication Stage 2: Competition Enters

**Market Condition:** The direct claim is working, but competitors have entered. Mere repetition is no longer enough.

**Headline Strategy:**
COPY THE SUCCESSFUL CLAIM - BUT ENLARGE ON IT.
Drive it to the absolute limit. Outbid competition.

**Examples:**
- "LOSE UP TO 47 POUNDS IN 4 WEEKS - OR RECEIVE $40 BACK!"
- "I AM 61 POUNDS LIGHTER... NEVER A HUNGRY MINUTE"

**Progression Pattern:**
- "PICK 25-50-100 ROSES FROM THIS ONE MAGNIFICENT PLANT!"
- Later: "SIX HUNDRED MUMS FROM A SINGLE BUSH!"
- Later: "WHO EVER HEARD OF 17,000 BLOOMS FROM A SINGLE PLANT?"

**Warning Signs of Stage End:**
- Successful claim becomes overworked
- Enlargement piles on enlargement
- Words begin to lose meaning ("whiter-than-whites")
- Prospects become confused, then skeptical
- Believability shatters
- Claims automatically discounted 50%
- Government investigation begins
- Sales curve turns down

---

### Sophistication Stage 3: Mechanism Stage

**Market Condition:** Prospects have heard all claims in all their extremes. They may have bought competitive products and been disappointed. Mere repetition or exaggeration won't work.

**Headline Strategy:**
Introduce A NEW MECHANISM - a new way to make old promises fresh and believable.

Shift emphasis from WHAT the product does to HOW it works.
Not accomplishment, but performance becomes dominant.

**Structure Change:**
- Stage 2: Full claim in headline, mechanism in subhead/body
- Stage 3: Mechanism in headline, claim abbreviated or implied

**Examples:**
- Stage 2: "I AM 61 POUNDS LIGHTER... NEVER A HUNGRY MINUTE" (claim dominant)
- Stage 3: "FLOATS FAT RIGHT OUT OF YOUR BODY!" (mechanism dominant)
- Stage 3: "FIRST WONDER DRUG FOR REDUCING!" (mechanism dominant)

**Copy Structure:**
Mechanism headline + Full claim restated in lead paragraph:

"FLOATS FAT RIGHT OUT OF YOUR BODY!"
*Released for the first time! The amazing scientific discovery that melts up to 37 POUNDS off men and women - without starvation diets, without a single hungry moment - without even giving up the foods you love!*

---

### Sophistication Stage 4: Mechanism Elaboration

**Market Condition:** A competitor has introduced a new mechanism that's producing sales. The mechanism advantage needs to be maintained or countered.

**Headline Strategy:**
ELABORATE OR ENLARGE UPON THE SUCCESSFUL MECHANISM.
- Make it easier
- Make it quicker
- Make it surer
- Solve more of the problem
- Overcome old limitations
- Promise extra benefits

**Examples:**
- Stage 3: "FIRST WONDER DRUG FOR REDUCING!"
- Stage 4: "FIRST NO-DIET REDUCING WONDER DRUG!"

**Cigarette Industry Examples:**
- Stage 3: "LUCKIES - THEY'RE TOASTED!"
- Stage 4: "PHILIP MORRIS - ALL THE HARSHNESS BAKED OUT!"
- Stage 3: "CHESTERFIELD - REGULAR AND KING-SIZED TOO!"
- Stage 4: "TAREYTON - DUAL FILTER FOR DOUBLE THE PLEASURE!"

**Limitation:**
Like Stage 2, eventually pushes beyond believability.

---

### Sophistication Stage 5: Market Exhaustion

**Market Condition:** No new mechanism will gain acceptance. Market is tired of promises and mechanisms. Prospects have been glutted by advertising. The field is "exhausted."

**Headline Strategy:**
SHIFT TO IDENTIFICATION.
Emphasis moves from promise and mechanism to identification with the prospect.

This corresponds directly to Stage 5 Awareness strategy.

**Approach:**
- Project strong visual/emotional identifications
- Headlines may become secondary to imagery
- Focus on who the prospect IS or wants to be

**Examples:**
- Marlboro "Virile Men" ads (no claims, pure identification)
- "WHY MEN CRACK..." (Postum - identification with fear)
- "BLOW SOME MY WAY" (opened women's cigarette market through identification)

**Revival Pattern:**
Once identification resets the market, it can begin the sophistication cycle again:
- "WINSTON TASTES GOOD LIKE A CIGARETTE SHOULD!" (back to taste/enjoyment)
- "IT'S WHAT'S UP FRONT THAT COUNTS!" (simple claim renewed)

## Part 4: Diagnostic Framework

### Step 1: Assess Awareness Level

Ask these questions in order:

1. **Do they know YOUR SPECIFIC PRODUCT and want it?**
   - YES = Most Aware (Stage 1)
   - NO = Continue

2. **Do they know your product exists but aren't convinced?**
   - YES = Product Aware (Stage 2)
   - NO = Continue

3. **Do they know they want the RESULT but not that products like yours exist?**
   - YES = Solution Aware (Stage 3)
   - NO = Continue

4. **Do they recognize they have a PROBLEM but don't know solutions exist?**
   - YES = Problem Aware (Stage 4)
   - NO = Completely Unaware (Stage 5)

### Step 2: Assess Market Sophistication

Ask these questions:

1. **Is this a new product category or new market application?**
   - YES = Stage 1 (First in Market)

2. **Are competitors making direct claims successfully?**
   - YES = Stage 2 (Enlarge the claim)

3. **Have direct claims been exhausted? Is the market skeptical of promises?**
   - YES = Stage 3 (Introduce mechanism)

4. **Are competitors advertising mechanisms successfully?**
   - YES = Stage 4 (Elaborate the mechanism)

5. **Has the market stopped responding to mechanisms? Is advertising glutted?**
   - YES = Stage 5 (Shift to identification)

### Step 3: Match Strategy to Position

Cross-reference your awareness level and sophistication stage:

**Example Combinations:**

- Solution Aware + Stage 1 Sophistication = Simple, direct promise headline
- Solution Aware + Stage 3 Sophistication = Mechanism-based promise headline
- Unaware + Stage 5 Sophistication = Pure identification headline

---

## Part 5: Key Principles

### The Headline's Only Job

Your headline has ONE job: **stop your prospect and compel them to read the second sentence.**

Every sentence thereafter has the same job - force them to read the next sentence. The more of your story they read, the more thoroughly you can sell them.

### The Psychological Wall

Each awareness stage is separated from the others by a psychological wall. On one side is indifference; on the other, intense interest.

**Critical:** A headline that works at one awareness stage will FAIL at another. A headline that works at one sophistication stage will fail when the market moves to a new stage.

### Markets Never Stand Still

- Markets change
- Desires change
- Fashions change
- Advertising styles change

What works today will become outdated. The challenge never ends.

### When Direct Methods Fail

If direct appeals to price, product, function, or desire aren't working, you're likely facing:
- Stage 5 Awareness (completely unaware)
- Stage 5 Sophistication (exhausted market)
- Or both

Solution: Shift to identification. Focus on the market itself. Echo emotions. Define the prospect for themselves.

---

## Summary: The Strategic Flow

1. **Identify awareness level** - How much does prospect know?
2. **Identify sophistication stage** - How much have they seen?
3. **Select appropriate headline strategy** - Match both factors
4. **Write headline that meets them where they are** - Don't assume awareness or trust
5. **Build copy that bridges to product** - Lead from their state to your solution
6. **Monitor market movement** - Awareness and sophistication change over time

The bridge between your market and your product is your ad. Start where they are. End with your product. Your headline is the first step of that bridge.
