## The SUCCESs Framework

The Heath Brothers' six principles for making ideas "stick" - ideas that are understandable, memorable, and effective in changing thought or behavior.

### S - Simple

**Core Principle**: Find the essential core of your idea and express it compactly.

- Strip the idea down to its most critical essence
- Be a "master of exclusion" - relentlessly prioritize
- **Simple does not mean short** - sound bites are not the ideal; proverbs are
- Create ideas that are both simple AND profound
- The Golden Rule is the ultimate model: one sentence so profound an individual could spend a lifetime following it

**Application**:
- A successful defense lawyer says: "If you argue ten points, even if each is a good point, when they get back to the jury room they won't remember any"
- Use analogies and schemas that already exist in readers' minds ("Jaws on a spaceship" = Alien)
- Commander's Intent: What is the single most important thing the reader must understand?

### U - Unexpected

**Core Principle**: Violate expectations to grab attention, then generate curiosity to hold it.

- Use surprise (an emotion that increases alertness and causes focus) to grab initial attention
- But surprise doesn't last - you need INTEREST for sustained engagement
- **Gap Theory of Curiosity**: Curiosity happens when we feel a gap in our knowledge
  - Gaps cause mental pain that we need to scratch
  - We sit through bad movies because it's too painful not to know how they end
  - Open gaps BEFORE you close them

**How to Create Gaps**:
- Pose questions or puzzles that confront readers with missing knowledge
- Point out that someone else knows something they don't
- Present situations with unknown resolutions
- Challenge readers to predict an outcome (creates TWO gaps: what will happen? + was I right?)

**Application**:
- News teasers work because they reveal you don't know something you didn't care about until you found out you didn't know it
- Shift thinking from "What information do I need to convey?" to "What questions do I want my audience to ask?"
- Combat overconfidence by making people commit to predictions before revealing answers

### C - Concrete

**Core Principle**: Explain ideas in terms of human actions and sensory information.

- Our brains are wired to remember concrete data
- Abstract language (mission statements, synergies, strategies, visions) is often meaningless
- Naturally sticky ideas are full of concrete images: ice-filled bathtubs, apples with razors
- In proverbs, abstract truths are encoded in concrete language: "A bird in hand is worth two in the bush"

**Why It Matters**:
- Speaking concretely is the only way to ensure your idea means the same thing to everyone
- Velcro theory of memory: More hooks = more things for memory to attach to
- Abstraction is the luxury of the expert - your readers aren't experts

**Application**:
- Replace "comprehensive community building" with stories about specific people doing specific things
- Make statistics tangible (see Human-Scale Principle below)
- Use sensory language readers can see, hear, feel, taste, and touch

### C - Credible

**Core Principle**: Give your ideas credentials that allow people to believe them.

**Sources of Credibility**:
1. **External Credibility**
   - Authorities and experts
   - Celebrities and aspirational figures
   - Anti-authorities (the person who lived it, like an ex-smoker)

2. **Internal Credibility**
   - Vivid details (the Darth Vader toothbrush effect - specific details boost believability)
   - Statistics made meaningful through context and scale
   - The Human-Scale Principle (see below)
   - The Sinatra Test ("If I can make it there, I can make it anywhere")

3. **Testable Credibility**
   - "Try before you buy" philosophy for ideas
   - Let readers test claims themselves
   - Reagan's question: "Are you better off today than you were four years ago?"

### E - Emotional

**Core Principle**: Make people feel something. Make people care.

**The Mother Teresa Principle**: "If I look at the one, I will act. If I look at the mass, I will not."

- Statistics about millions don't move us
- Stories about individuals do
- People donate more to one starving child than to statistics about millions

**WIIFY - What's In It For You**:
- Appeal to self-interest (WIIFY is everyone's favorite radio station)
- But go beyond basic self-interest to identity and values
- People act based on "What would someone like me do in this situation?"

**Semantic Stretch Warning**:
- Words like "unique" and "quality" lose meaning through overuse
- Don't rely on tired emotional words - show, don't tell

### S - Stories

**Core Principle**: Stories are flight simulators for the brain.

**Three Basic Plots That Work**:
1. **The Challenge Plot**: Obstacles overcome, underdog triumphs (Jared losing 200 lbs eating Subway)
2. **The Connection Plot**: People bridging gaps, developing relationships
3. **The Creativity Plot**: Mental breakthroughs, someone solving a puzzle, making a discovery

**Why Stories Work**:
- Stories provide simulation (knowledge about how to act)
- Stories provide inspiration (motivation to act)
- Stories are easier to remember than facts
- Stories are more likely to be retold

**Application**:
- Use "springboard stories" - stories that help people see how an idea might work
- Shop talk and case studies are stories
- Look for stories in your customers' experiences

---

## The Curse of Knowledge

**The Core Problem**: Once you know something, you find it hard to imagine what it was like not to know it.

- The "tapper and listener" experiment: Tappers predicted 50% success rate; actual was 2.5%
- Tappers heard the song in their head; listeners heard random taps
- You can't unlearn what you already know

**How It Manifests in Copy**:
- CEOs talking about "unlocking shareholder value" when employees hear nothing
- Experts using jargon that means nothing to prospects
- Assuming readers have context they don't have
- Skipping steps that seem obvious to you

**The Only Two Solutions**:
1. Don't learn anything (not practical)
2. Transform your ideas using SUCCESs principles

**Self-Check Questions**:
- Would my mother understand this?
- If I knew nothing about this topic, would this make sense?
- Am I assuming knowledge my reader doesn't have?
- Am I using words that only insiders know?

---

## The Human-Scale Principle

**Core Concept**: Make statistics tangible by contextualizing them in human, everyday terms.

### Why Raw Statistics Fail

- "37 grams of saturated fat" means nothing
- "5,000 nuclear warheads" is just a big number
- Large numbers become abstractions that don't move people

### How to Apply Human Scale

**Comparison Examples**:

| Abstract | Human-Scale |
|----------|-------------|
| 37 grams saturated fat | "A whole day's worth of unhealthy eating" |
| 5,000 nuclear warheads | "One BB = one nuclear warhead" (visualize pile of BBs) |
| Sun to Earth accuracy | New York to Los Angeles accuracy (83% vs 58% found impressive) |
| $500/year wireless cost | "1-2 minutes of productivity per day pays for it" |
| 23,000 employee poll | "If a soccer team had these scores, only 4 of 11 would know which goal is theirs" |

**The Soccer Team Analogy** (Covey's Transformation):
- Original: "Only 37% have clear understanding of goals; only 20% enthusiastic..."
- Transformed: "Only 4 of 11 players would know which goal is theirs. Only 2 would care. Only 2 would know their position."

### Guidelines for Human Scale

1. **Use Familiar Frames of Reference**
   - Football fields, city blocks, familiar distances
   - Time periods people can grasp (per day, per week)
   - Money amounts people handle regularly

2. **Make it Personal**
   - "For about the cost of a cup of coffee per day..."
   - "In less time than your lunch break..."
   - "About the size of your smartphone..."

3. **Use Comparisons That Surprise**
   - Deer kill 300x more people than sharks
   - Movie popcorn = bacon + eggs + Big Mac + fries

4. **Let People Test For Themselves**
   - Reagan's "Are you better off?" question
   - Provide checkable, verifiable claims

---

## Gap Theory of Curiosity

**Loewenstein's Key Insight**: Curiosity happens when we feel a gap in our knowledge. Gaps cause pain that we need to relieve.

### How Gaps Work

- Movies work by posing questions ("What will happen?")
- Mysteries work by posing questions ("Who did it?")
- Sports work by posing questions ("Who will win?")
- We sit through bad movies because not knowing is too painful

### Creating Gaps in Copy

**Open Gaps Before Closing Them**:
- Our tendency is to tell people facts immediately
- But first, they must realize they NEED these facts
- The trick is highlighting specific knowledge they're missing

**Methods to Open Gaps**:
1. Pose a question or puzzle
2. Point out someone else knows something they don't
3. Present situations with unknown resolutions
4. Challenge them to predict an outcome
5. Create scenarios that imply missing information

**The News Teaser Technique**:
- "There's a new drug sweeping the teenage community - and it may be in your medicine cabinet!"
- Works because it reveals you don't know something you didn't care about until now
- Use a "little dollop" of this approach in your copy

### Gap Theory Dynamics

**Gaps Grow With Knowledge**:
- Someone who knows 17 of 50 state capitals feels proud
- Someone who knows 47 feels bothered by not knowing 3
- The more you know, the more you focus on what you don't know

**Battling Overconfidence**:
- People think they know more than they do
- Make them commit to predictions before revealing answers
- Show that others disagree (creates curiosity about who's right)

**Priming the Gap**:
- Give enough context that readers realize what they don't know
- Background information makes gaps more felt
- "You know about A and B... but did you know about C?"

## The Specificity Principle

Claude Hopkins' fundamental insight from Scientific Advertising: Specific claims are more believable and more powerful than general claims.

### Why Generalities Fail

- "Best in the world" and "Lowest prices" roll off like water from a duck
- Superlatives suggest exaggeration and carelessness with truth
- Readers discount ALL statements from someone who uses vague claims
- General statements count for little because everyone expects selling talk

### Why Specifics Work

**A specific claim is either true or a lie** - people don't expect advertisers to lie in legitimate media.

**The Weight of Specifics**:
- "Tungsten lamp gives more light than carbon" = doubt
- "Tungsten lamp gives 3 1/3 times the light" = acceptance (implies testing)
- "Prices reduced" = no impression
- "Prices reduced 25%" = full value of announcement

### Classic Examples from Hopkins

| Generic Claim | Specific Claim | Result |
|---------------|----------------|--------|
| "Lowest prices in America" | "Our net profit is 3%" | Sensational business increase |
| "Profits are fair" | "Our profit is 9%" + $735 hidden costs breakdown | Great success |
| "Abundant lather" | "Multiplies itself 250 times" | Quick, great success |
| "Quick shave" | "78-second shave" | Sensational sales advance |
| "Pure beer" | 4,000 feet for water, 1,018 experiments, plate glass cooling room | Greatest success in beer advertising |
| "Used the world over" | "Used by peoples of 52 nations" | Many followed |

### The Schlitz Beer Story

Every brewer could claim "pure beer" - but one brewer described:
- Plate glass rooms where beer cooled in filtered air
- Filters of white wood pulp for every drop
- Bottles washed four times by machinery
- 4,000 feet deep for pure water
- 1,018 experiments for the perfect yeast
- Mother cell that all yeast came from

**Result**: Greatest success ever made in beer advertising - by describing what every brewer did, but being the first to SAY it.

### Application Guidelines

1. **Replace adjectives with numbers**
   - Not "many customers" but "2,847 customers"
   - Not "fast results" but "results in 14 days"
   - Not "big savings" but "save $347 per month"

2. **Describe processes**
   - How is it made? How long does it take?
   - What ingredients/components? From where?
   - How many steps? How many tests?

3. **Provide comparisons**
   - X times better than Y
   - Same as Z but costs 40% less
   - Takes 1/3 the time of traditional methods

4. **Use odd numbers for believability**
   - $97 sounds more real than $100
   - 17 techniques sounds more researched than "many techniques"
   - 2,847 customers sounds counted; "thousands" sounds guessed

## Extreme Specificity (Cashvertising Secret #9)

Drew Eric Whitman's extension of Hopkins' principle into a competitive weapon.

### The Pizza Shop Experiment

Whitman called 25 pizza shops asking "What makes your pizza better?"

**Typical Response**: "We use better ingredients" (tells nothing, creates no images)

**Better Response**: "Our sauce and flour are from Italy" (specifies WHICH ingredients, WHERE from)

**Extreme Specificity Response**:
- Buffalo milk mozzarella (not just cow-milk)
- Cheese placed in chunks, never shredded (releases too much moisture)
- Only hard, northern spring wheat flour (excellent rising, crisp exterior, chewy interior)
- Hand-crushed Genuine San Marzano tomatoes from Italy
- Extra-virgin Olivieri olive oil
- Hand-stretched dough (not steel rollers)
- Coal-burning oven imported from Italy
- Fresh herbs grown on-site
- Four generations of pizza-making mastery

### The Restaurant Comparison

**Restaurant #1 (Luigi's)**:
"Wonderful home cooking. Chicken parmesan, spaghetti, manicotti, and more. Plus, a coupon."

**Restaurant #2 (Fratelli's)**:
"We make our bread fresh every day, golden and crusty. Our pasta is made from scratch. We use only fresh herbs in all our recipes. Only pure, cold-pressed 100-percent virgin olive oil is served. Spring water fills your glass, mellow Italian music fills the air, and softly glowing candles light your table."

**The Difference**: Fratelli's creates a FEELING. It paints pictures and causes demonstration in the mind before stepping through the door.

### The Hardware Store Comparison

**Hardware Store #1**:
"Hammers, screwdrivers, power tools, home fix-up, lawn and garden equipment. Paulson's has the hardware you're looking for...at neighborhood-friendly prices!"

**Hardware Store #2**:
"Handyman Jack's is no ordinary hardware store. We're a Hardware Super Store! We carry 343 kinds of fasteners, 28 types of nails, 86 gauges of wire, 43 grit sizes of sandpaper, 16 different styles of hammers, 28 kinds of screwdrivers, 47 types of keys, a daily inventory of 354,000 bolts and screws, all the top-name power tools for less, and a no-nonsense, money-back guarantee."

### The Length-Implies-Strength Heuristic

Even if every competitor has the same inventory:
- No one else SAYS it
- People judge the one who DOES say it to be better, more complete, more successful
- Specific numbers imply counting, testing, and verification

### Key Questions for Extreme Specificity

1. What can I say that may be obvious to me but my market knows little about?
2. Can I describe processes, time, money, and effort expended?
3. How can I point out advantages and make people question competitors' quality?
4. What is the story behind how this is made/delivered/created?

## Powerful Visual Adjectives (PVAs) - Cashvertising Secret #17

PVAs produce clear, bright, high-impact visual images that help prospects demonstrate your products in their minds.

### The Transformation Principle

**Before PVAs**:
"You get six red apples hand-picked by my mother from our backyard farm, so delicious, they're probably the best apples you've ever eaten."

**After PVAs**:
"Just wait until you sink your teeth into the sweetest, juiciest, most mouth-watering Red Delicious apples you've ever eaten! Not just one or two. But a full one-dozen of these crisp, luscious beauties, each one carefully hand-picked by my 73-year old mother from the golden, sun-drenched orchards in our very own backyard!"

### PVA Transformations

| Generic | With PVAs |
|---------|-----------|
| Make lots of money | Rake in $2,750 cash weekly |
| Juicy red apples | Mouth-watering, sugar-sweet, hand-picked apples |
| Drink cleaner water | Enjoy pure, crystal-clear, glacier-fresh water |
| Get a useful line of credit | Flash your credit card, and jewelry, electronics, home furnishings, and tropical vacations are yours |
| Earn good money selling gold | Corner the gold market at high-traffic flea markets and watch the dollars come pouring in |

### Categories of PVAs

**Sensory Adjectives**:
- Visual: gleaming, sparkling, sun-drenched, crystal-clear
- Tactile: silky, velvety, crisp, smooth
- Taste: mouth-watering, sugar-sweet, tangy, zesty
- Sound: crackling, thundering, whisper-soft
- Smell: fragrant, aromatic, fresh-baked

**Emotional Adjectives**:
- Excitement: thrilling, electrifying, pulse-pounding
- Comfort: cozy, soothing, peaceful, serene
- Prestige: exclusive, elite, distinguished, prestigious
- Power: commanding, unstoppable, dominant

**Magnitude Adjectives**:
- Size: towering, massive, compact, pocket-sized
- Quantity: overflowing, abundant, jam-packed
- Intensity: blazing, explosive, turbo-charged

### Application Guidelines

1. **Replace weak adjectives with PVAs**
   - "Good" becomes "exceptional" or "remarkable"
   - "Nice" becomes "delightful" or "charming"
   - "Big" becomes "massive" or "towering"

2. **Stack compatible PVAs**
   - "Crisp, luscious beauties"
   - "Pure, crystal-clear, glacier-fresh"
   - Don't overdo - 2-3 maximum per noun phrase

3. **Use PVAs to trigger mental movies**
   - "Watch the dollars come pouring in"
   - "Sink your teeth into"
   - Action verbs + sensory details

4. **Age and specificity add power**
   - Not "my mother" but "my 73-year-old mother"
   - Not "our farm" but "sun-drenched orchards in our very own backyard"

## Body Copy Proof Types

Kyle Milligan's framework from Take Their Money for building credible, persuasive body copy.

### The Body Copy Template

Every section of body copy follows this pattern:

1. **Objection** - What resistance or question might the reader have?
2. **Claim** - The statement that addresses the objection
3. **Proof** - Evidence supporting the claim (aim for 3 pieces)
4. **Benefit** - What this means for the reader's life

### Common Objections to Anticipate

**Using the Big 4 Emotions Framework**:

| Emotion | Sample Objections |
|---------|-------------------|
| New | Why am I just hearing about this? Is this legitimate? |
| Easy | Do I need experience? Is this too complicated? Will this take a lot of time? |
| Safe | Is this risky? What if it doesn't work? How do I know this will work? |
| Big | How much money can I make? How fast will I see results? |

**Expanded Objection List**:
- Why shouldn't I just use an alternative?
- Why should I act now?
- Who are you?
- Why should I listen to you?
- How did you figure this out?
- How does it work?
- Why are you telling me about this?
- What do I need to get started?
- How much does it cost?
- What if it doesn't work?

### Types of Proof

**The Seven Core Proof Types**:

1. **Case Studies** - Detailed examples of success stories
2. **Demonstrations** - Show the product/system working
3. **Testimonials** - Customer/user statements
4. **Quotes from Authorities** - Expert endorsements, media mentions
5. **Charts and Graphs** - Visual data representation
6. **Official Documents** - Patents, certifications, studies
7. **Articles and Headlines** - Third-party media coverage

### The Rule of Threes

**Generally, proof comes in threes**:
- One or two pieces of proof feels "unresolved"
- Three is the magic number
- More than three is great, but three is the minimum

**Example - Proving "$10,000 with this system"**:

> "Look at what happened when my system said buy Stock ABC..."
> [Chart of Stock ABC]
> "You could have made $5,000!"
>
> "And then the system said buy Stock DEF..."
> [Chart of Stock DEF]
> "You could have made $7,500!"
>
> "Now wait until I show you Stock GHI..."
> [Chart of Stock GHI]
> "You could have made a whopping $10,000!"

### Show, Don't Tell

When offering proof:
- Present number gains as visuals (charts, graphs)
- Re-present each piece of proof 2-3 times in different ways
- This is called a "reframe"

### Reframing Proof

**Definition**: Presenting a new perspective on the same information to make it three-dimensional.

**Example Reframes**:

Original: "You could have made $10,000!"

Reframes:
- "Make that much every month and you're clearing six-figures in yearly income!"
- "That's 765 times more than what you'd have made in the S&P 500 for the entire year!"
- "Enough to pay off your car in a single trade!"

### The "Imagine" Technique for Benefits

After establishing your proof, paint the picture:

> "Won't you be the talk of the town?
>
> Imagine it...
>
> People will whisper about you, 'how did he afford that fancy new car?'
>
> 'Did you see his new pool?'
>
> 'What about that trip to Italy he took his family on! Where did he get ALL THAT MONEY?'"

**Variations**:
- Start with "Imagine..."
- Or skip the word and just describe the scene
- "You'll speak with confidence and make friends easily..."

### The Seven Deadly Benefits

People buy to satisfy fundamental desires (the "dark side" of benefits):

1. **Lust** - Attractiveness, desirability
2. **Gluttony** - Abundance, more than enough
3. **Greed** - Wealth, possessions, accumulation
4. **Sloth** - Ease, convenience, doing less
5. **Wrath** - Revenge, proving others wrong
6. **Envy** - Having what others have (or more)
7. **Pride** - Status, recognition, dignity

**Application**:
- They want to lord it over their judgmental father-in-law
- They want dignity when playing golf with skilled friends
- They want the easier solution that doesn't require discipline
- Things people think are most personal are actually most universal

## The Proof Hierarchy

Organize proof elements from most to least credible for your specific audience.

### Tier 1: Irrefutable Proof

- **Official data and documents**: Government statistics, public records, patents
- **Independent third-party verification**: Academic studies, scientific research
- **Physical demonstrations**: Live proof that the thing works

### Tier 2: Authority Proof

- **Expert endorsements**: Recognized authorities in the field
- **Institutional validation**: Universities, research organizations
- **Media coverage**: Reputable publications, news outlets
- **Industry recognition**: Awards, certifications, rankings

### Tier 3: Social Proof

- **Customer testimonials**: Real people with real results
- **Case studies**: Detailed success stories with specifics
- **User numbers**: "Join 2,847 other customers"
- **Reviews and ratings**: Aggregated customer feedback

### Tier 4: Demonstrated Proof

- **Before/after comparisons**: Visual or numerical transformation
- **Charts and graphs**: Data visualization
- **Process revelation**: Show how the mechanism works
- **Competitive comparison**: Side-by-side with alternatives

### Tier 5: Logical Proof

- **Reason-why explanations**: Logical arguments for how it works
- **Analogies and metaphors**: Comparisons to understood concepts
- **Mathematical calculations**: When the math proves the point
- **Common sense arguments**: "You already know that..."

### Stacking Proof for Maximum Impact

**Best Practice**: Combine multiple tiers in each proof section

Example:
> "According to a Stanford University study [Tier 2], users saw an average 47% improvement [Tier 4]. Here's what John Martinez, a construction foreman from Dallas, experienced [Tier 3]: 'I couldn't believe it. In just three weeks, I went from struggling to exceeding my quota.' That makes sense when you understand the mechanism [Tier 5]..."
