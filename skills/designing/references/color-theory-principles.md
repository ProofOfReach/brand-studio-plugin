# Color Theory Principles Reference

## Albers' Core Principle

> "Color is the most relative medium in art."

The same color looks different depending on:
- What colors surround it
- The size of the color area
- The lighting conditions
- What colors were seen before it

**Key insight**: There is no "true" color perception. Context changes everything.

## Color Relativity (Albers)

### 1 Color Appears as 2
Place the same color on two different backgrounds:
- On a dark background: appears lighter
- On a light background: appears darker
- On warm background: appears cooler
- On cool background: appears warmer

### 2 Colors Appear as 1
By manipulating backgrounds, two different colors can be made to look identical.

### Simultaneous Contrast
Your eye automatically generates the complement of any color you stare at:
- Stare at red → see green afterimage
- Stare at blue → see orange afterimage
- This affects how adjacent colors appear

## Color Properties

| Property | Description | Effect |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| **Hue** | The color family (red, blue, green) | Primary identity |
| **Value/Lightness** | Light to dark | Creates hierarchy, depth |
| **Saturation/Chroma** | Pure to muted/grey | Energy level, prominence |
| **Temperature** | Warm (red/yellow) vs cool (blue/green) | Emotional response |

## Color Relationships

### Complementary Colors
- Opposite on the color wheel
- Maximum contrast
- Each makes the other appear more vibrant
- Examples: Red/Green, Blue/Orange, Yellow/Purple

### Analogous Colors
- Adjacent on the color wheel
- Natural harmony
- Low contrast, cohesive feel
- Examples: Blue/Blue-Green/Green

### Triadic Colors
- Three colors equally spaced (120°)
- Vibrant, balanced contrast
- Examples: Red/Yellow/Blue, Orange/Green/Purple

### Split Complementary
- One color + two colors adjacent to its complement
- High contrast but more nuanced than pure complementary
- Example: Blue + Yellow-Orange + Red-Orange

## The Weber-Fechner Law (Albers)

Visual perception follows geometric, not arithmetic, progression:
- To perceive equal steps of darkness, you must double the pigment each time
- 1, 2, 4, 8, 16... not 1, 2, 3, 4, 5...
- Explains why subtle gradations are hard to achieve

**Practical implication**: When creating value scales or gradients, the steps must accelerate, not remain equal.

## Color and Space

### Advancing Colors (Come Forward)
- Warm colors (red, orange, yellow)
- Bright, saturated colors
- High contrast with background

### Receding Colors (Fall Back)
- Cool colors (blue, green, purple)
- Muted, desaturated colors
- Low contrast with background

### Creating Depth with Color
- Warm foreground + cool background = depth
- Saturated center + muted edges = focus
- High contrast near + low contrast far = atmosphere

## Color Harmony: Albers' Challenge

Albers rejected formulaic "harmony rules":

> "We may forget for a while those rules of thumb of complementaries... and of triads and tetrads as well. They are worn out."

Instead:
- **Any color can work with any other color** if quantities are appropriate
- Harmony is about relationships, not formulas
- Context determines whether colors "work"

## Color Quantity Principles

The same 4 colors create completely different effects based on:
1. **Size/area** - Which color dominates?
2. **Recurrence** - How often does each appear?
3. **Placement** - Where is each positioned?

**Example**: Red dominant = energetic; Blue dominant = calm (same 4 colors)

## Transparency Illusion (Albers)

Creating the appearance of overlapping transparent colors:
1. Two "parent" colors
2. One "mixture" color that appears where they overlap
3. The mixture must be believably "in between" the parents in both hue and value

This creates:
- Depth perception
- Visual sophistication
- Spatial relationships

## Warm vs Cool Palettes

### Warm Palettes
- Red, orange, yellow, warm brown
- Feel: Energy, urgency, appetite, warmth, excitement
- Best for: Food, energy, entertainment, action

### Cool Palettes
- Blue, green, purple, grey
- Feel: Calm, trust, professionalism, sophistication
- Best for: Technology, finance, healthcare, corporate

### Neutral Palettes
- White, grey, black, beige, taupe
- Feel: Timeless, sophisticated, flexible
- Best for: Luxury, minimalism, letting content shine

## Color Psychology (Brand Context)

| Color | Associations | Common Uses |
|-------|--------------|-------------|
| **Red** | Energy, passion, urgency, danger | Sales, food, entertainment |
| **Orange** | Friendly, confident, creative | Tech, food, children |
| **Yellow** | Optimism, clarity, warmth | Caution, children, food |
| **Green** | Nature, growth, health, money | Eco, health, finance |
| **Blue** | Trust, stability, calm, corporate | Tech, finance, healthcare |
| **Purple** | Luxury, creativity, wisdom | Luxury, beauty, creative |
| **Pink** | Feminine, playful, romantic | Beauty, children, fashion |
| **Brown** | Earthy, reliable, rustic | Organic, outdoor, coffee |
| **Black** | Sophisticated, powerful, elegant | Luxury, fashion, tech |
| **White** | Pure, clean, simple | Healthcare, tech, minimal |

## 2026 Anti-AI Color Trends

Avoid overused AI-generated color clichés:
- Purple/blue gradients (Tailwind defaults)
- Neon cyber palettes
- Generic corporate blue

Instead consider:
- **Warm palettes**: Terracotta, sage, cream, ochre
- **Earthy tones**: Clay, moss, sand, rust
- **Intentional imperfection**: Slightly "off" combinations
- **Heritage colors**: Vintage-inspired, pre-digital palettes

## Prompt Enhancement for Color

When specifying color in image generation:

**Palette types:**
- Monochromatic, analogous, complementary, triadic
- Warm, cool, neutral, earth tones
- Muted, vibrant, pastel, jewel tones

**Specific color descriptors:**
- Instead of "blue": Navy, cobalt, cerulean, teal, slate, robin's egg
- Instead of "red": Crimson, burgundy, coral, terracotta, rust, cherry
- Instead of "green": Forest, sage, olive, emerald, mint, chartreuse

**Mood-based:**
- Sophisticated: Deep, muted, high contrast
- Friendly: Warm, medium saturation, approachable
- Professional: Conservative, limited palette, subtle
- Creative: Unexpected combinations, bold choices

**Technical:**
- Limited palette (2-3 colors)
- High contrast for accessibility
- Works in black and white (value contrast)
