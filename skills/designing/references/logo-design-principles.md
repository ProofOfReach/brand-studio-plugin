# Logo Design Principles Reference

## The 7 Ingredients of Iconic Logos (Airey)

1. **Keep It Simple** - Simple logos are easier to recognize at a glance
2. **Make It Relevant** - Appropriate for the intended audience and industry
3. **Incorporate Tradition** - Aim for designs that last decades, not trends
4. **Aim for Distinction** - Must work in black and white first
5. **Commit to Memory** - Memorable after a single viewing
6. **Think Small** - Design for smallest size first (favicon, app icon)
7. **Focus on One Thing** - One memorable feature beats many forgettable ones

## Sequence of Cognition (Wheeler)

How humans perceive logos:
1. **Shape** - First thing registered
2. **Color** - Second thing registered
3. **Form** - Content/detail perceived last

**Implication**: The shape must work before color is added.

## Brand Marks Classification (Wheeler)

| Type | Description | Best For | Examples |
|------|-------------|----------|----------|
| **Wordmark** | Freestanding word/words | Distinctive names | Google, Coca-Cola, FedEx |
| **Letterform** | Single letter or initials | Long company names | IBM, HBO, CNN |
| **Pictorial** | Recognizable literal image | Strong metaphors | Apple, Twitter bird, Shell |
| **Abstract** | Non-literal symbol | Global/diverse brands | Nike swoosh, Pepsi |
| **Emblem** | Mark + wordmark intertwined | Heritage/traditional | Harley-Davidson, Starbucks |
| **Dynamic** | Flexible, changing identity | Media/tech/creative | Google Doodles, MTV |

## Visual Design Principles

### Shape Fundamentals
- **Geometric shapes** convey stability, order, professionalism
- **Organic shapes** convey creativity, approachability, nature
- **Angular shapes** convey energy, aggression, technology
- **Rounded shapes** convey friendliness, safety, comfort

### Negative Space
- Use negative space to create hidden meanings (FedEx arrow)
- Empty space is as important as filled space
- Creates visual interest and memorability
- Makes logos more sophisticated

### Balance Types
- **Symmetrical**: Formal, stable, traditional
- **Asymmetrical**: Dynamic, modern, energetic
- **Radial**: Unified, powerful, centered

### Line Weight
- **Thick lines**: Bold, confident, strong
- **Thin lines**: Elegant, refined, delicate
- **Variable weight**: Dynamic, organic, hand-crafted feel

## Mind Mapping for Concepts (Airey)

Process for generating logo ideas:
1. Write brand name in center
2. Add associated words radiating outward
3. From each word, add more associations
4. Look for unexpected connections between distant concepts
5. These connections yield the most creative solutions

**Example for a coffee shop called "Sunrise Brew":**
- Sunrise → warmth, orange, horizon, new beginning, rooster, rays
- Brew → steam, cup, beans, ritual, morning, comfort
- Connections: Steam rising like sun rays, cup as horizon, warmth = both

## Testing Logo Concepts

### The Swap Test (Neumeier)
Swap your logo with a competitor's - if no worse, your logo lacks distinction.

### Quick Visual Tests
- **Squint test**: Recognizable when blurred?
- **Distance test**: Works from 20 feet away?
- **Inversion test**: Still balanced upside down?
- **Thumbnail test**: Works at 16x16 pixels?
- **Reverse test**: Works white on black?

## What Logos Should NOT Do

- Literally depict what the company does (lawyer doesn't need scales)
- Follow current design trends (will date quickly)
- Use more than 2 typefaces
- Be overly complicated or detailed
- Require color to be understood
- Look like stock clipart
- Ignore cultural meanings of symbols
