- **Web Copy That Sells** by Maria Veloso
- **The Conversion Code** by Chris Smith

## Core Philosophy

**You're not selling a product. You're selling your prospects a better version of themselves.**

Your job is to know your visitors, customers, and prospects so well that you understand:
- The situation they're in right now
- Where they'd like to be
- Exactly how your solution will get them to their ideal self

The best-converting copy doesn't come from a copywriter - it comes from the people who have bought or are likely to buy your solution.

### Frame-of-Mind Marketing (Veloso)

Traditional marketing asks: "How do I find customers for my products/services?"

Frame-of-Mind Marketing flips this: **"How do I find products/services for my customers?"**

This reframe changes everything about how you write emails:
- Start with understanding your prospect's current mental state
- Write from inside their perspective, not yours
- Position your offer as the natural solution to their existing desires

The key insight: Your prospects are already in a specific frame of mind when they read your email. Your job is to **meet them there**, then guide them toward the action you want.

**Application to Email:**
1. Identify the emotional state they're in when opening your email
2. Acknowledge that state in your opening line
3. Bridge from their current frame to your desired outcome
4. Make the CTA feel like their natural next step

## 1. Subject Line Formulas

Subject lines function like headlines - they must stop readers in their tracks and compel them to open.

### Formula Categories

#### The Timed "Or Else" Promise
```
[Highly desirable thing] + [time limit] + [consequence if not delivered]

Examples:
- "Your dream results in 7 days or your money back"
- "Set up your campaign in 15 minutes... or we'll do it for you"
```

#### The "Even-If" Objection Stomper
```
"Now" + [highly desirable thing you can do] + "even if" + [objection]

Examples:
- "Now you can build an audience even if you're starting from zero"
- "Now you can run user tests even if you have almost no budget"
```

#### The How-To
```
"How to" + [verb + noun] + [benefit]

Examples:
- "How to support customers 7x faster with [Product]"
- "How to double your open rates this week"
```

#### The Quantity/Number
```
[Numeral + noun(s)] + [verb] + [object]

Examples:
- "64,456 people have already discovered this"
- "Get 1,000+ new subscribers"
```

#### The List
```
[Numeral + noun] + [pronoun] + [big, scary problem]
OR
[Numeral + noun] + "to" + [verb] + [benefit]

Examples:
- "7 signs your emails are going to spam"
- "3 insanely satisfying ways to boost your open rates"
```

#### The Why/When/How Question
```
"Why", "When", or "How" + [statement of great intrigue]

Examples:
- "Why your best customers aren't opening your emails"
- "How [Company] saved $300 per month on email tools"
```

#### The Simile
```
[Do X] + "like" + [Y]

Examples:
- "Write emails like a pro copywriter"
- "Convert subscribers like [well-known brand]"
```

### Subject Line Power Tips

1. **Use trigger words**: secret, curious, instantly, worth, one and only, while you sleep, the reason, feel
2. **Be unexpected**: Use unusual analogies, ask unusual questions, reference exciting known goods
3. **Tap into visceral emotions**: Greed, pride, power, the desire for recognition
4. **Stomp one objection**: Address the biggest or most curious objection
5. **Make a believable promise**: Almost unbelievable, but not impossible to believe
6. **Give a time limit**: Hours, days, maybe weeks - but not months or years
7. **Use odd numbers**: 7 performs better than 10; imperfect numbers feel more organic
8. **Use numerals, not words**: "7" is more noticeable than "seven"

### Subject Lines to Avoid

- "The future of [X] is here"
- "Welcome to [anything]"
- "[Noun] just got [adjective]" (e.g., "Email marketing just got easier")
- Tagline-style: "Word. Word. Word."

### Subject Line Techniques (Veloso)

**The Power of "This"**

Using "this" creates curiosity because it implies something specific without revealing it:
```
"This is why your campaigns fail"
"Don't do this with your first email"
"This one change doubled my response rate"
```

**The Ellipsis Technique**

Trailing off with "..." creates an open loop that demands closure:
```
"I wasn't going to tell you, but..."
"What happened next surprised everyone..."
"The real reason your emails don't convert..."
```

**Why/What/How Starters**

Question words engage the brain's problem-solving mode:
```
"Why most email sequences fail"
"What top performers know about follow-up"
"How to write emails that get responses"
```

### Words That Trigger Spam Filters and Skepticism (Veloso)

**Avoid these words in subject lines and opening paragraphs:**

| Word | Why It Fails |
|------|--------------|
| Free | Spam trigger, sounds too good to be true |
| Buy | Screams advertisement |
| Discount | Devalues your offer, attracts bargain hunters |
| Opportunity | Overused, associated with MLM/scams |
| Maximize | Vague corporate-speak |
| Incredible/Amazing | Hyperbole without proof |
| Limited time | Overused, loses urgency |
| Act now | Pushy, triggers resistance |

**Instead, use:**
- "Complimentary" instead of "Free"
- "Invest in" instead of "Buy"
- "Special pricing" instead of "Discount"
- Describe the specific benefit instead of vague superlatives

## 2. Email Sequence Frameworks

### The Seven Elements of Emails That Sell (Veloso)

Every high-converting email contains these seven elements:

**1. Compelling Subject Line**
- Personal, not ad-like
- Sounds like it came from a friend, colleague, or trusted source
- Avoids spam trigger words
- Creates genuine curiosity

**2. First Sentence Establishes Rapport**
- Never jump straight to selling
- Acknowledge something about them or reference a shared context
- Make them feel understood before asking for anything

**3. Stay on Point (Inverted Pyramid)**
- Most important information first
- Support details second
- Background/context last
- Readers scan from top down; many never reach the bottom

**4. Single Message, Single Path**
- One core idea per email
- One clear direction for the reader
- Multiple offers = confusion = no action

**5. Provide Value**
- Every email should give before it asks
- Information, insight, entertainment, or resources
- Build reciprocity through consistent value delivery

**6. Demonstrate Benefit**
- Not features, but outcomes
- Not what it is, but what it does for them
- Paint the after picture

**7. Clear Call to Action**
- One specific action
- Make it obvious
- Remove friction from taking the action

### State of Awareness Model

Match your email content to where your reader is in their awareness journey:

| Awareness Level | Email Strategy |
|-----------------|----------------|
| **Unaware** | Longer emails, more storytelling, explain the pain they don't know they have |
| **Problem-Aware** | Acknowledge their pain, introduce that solutions exist |
| **Solution-Aware** | Show why your solution is best among alternatives |
| **Product-Aware** | Focus on differentiators, handle objections |
| **Most Aware** | Short, tight, focused on assurances, scarcity, incentives |

**Key insight**: As deadlines to purchase get closer, emails should get shorter, tighter, more to-the-point, and focused on assurances, scarcity, and incentives.

### The 8 Common Sales Objections to Address

1. I don't really NEED this
2. I don't have the AUTHORITY to buy this
3. I don't want to be SOLD TO
4. I have to PRIORITIZE other things right now
5. My EXISTING SOLUTION works well enough
6. Your company doesn't have the CAPABILITY or CREDIBILITY
7. I don't think your PRICES are reasonable
8. I'll have to spend time CONVINCING OTHERS

### Reasons to Believe (Use in Email Sequences)

Include these throughout your sequences to build trust:
- Money-back guarantee
- Free trial period
- Free shipping/returns
- 24/7 customer service
- Social proof (#1 best-selling, trusted by X people)
- Security guarantees
- No-questions-asked returns

### The Rule of Seven (Veloso)

**Prospects typically need 7+ touchpoints before taking action.**

Most marketers give up after 2-3 emails. This is a critical error:
- Only 2% of sales happen on the first contact
- 80% of sales require 5-12 contacts
- The prospect who doesn't respond today may buy in 6 months

**Application:**
- Plan sequences of at least 7 emails
- Space them appropriately (daily for hot leads, weekly for nurture)
- Each email should provide value, not just "checking in"
- Vary the format and approach across the sequence
- Don't interpret silence as rejection

### The Three-Word Email (Veloso)

When all else fails, extreme brevity cuts through noise:

```
Subject: Quick question

[First name] -

Did you get my email?

[Your name]
```

Or the variant:
```
Subject: Just checking

[First name] -

Thoughts on this?

[Your name]
```

**Why it works:**
- Feels personal, not automated
- Creates guilt/obligation
- Easy to respond to
- Doesn't overwhelm

---

## 3. Speed-to-Lead and Follow-Up Science (Smith)

### The Speed-to-Lead Imperative

Research shows response time dramatically affects conversion:

| Response Time | Impact |
|--------------|--------|
| Within 1 minute | 391% higher conversion |
| Within 5 minutes | 8x more likely to qualify lead |
| Within 10 minutes | 4x drop in qualification rate |
| After 30 minutes | Almost 100x drop in contact rate |

**Key insight:** The first company to respond usually wins the deal, regardless of who's "best."

### The Double Tap Technique (Smith)

When a lead comes in, don't just send an email. Use a coordinated two-channel approach:

**Step 1: Send Email**
```
Subject: Great to hear from you, [First name]

[First name],

Thanks for reaching out about [specific thing they inquired about].

I'd love to learn more about what you're looking for.
I have a few questions that will help me point you in the right direction.

When would be a good time for a quick call this week?

[Your name]
[Phone number]
```

**Step 2: Send Text (within 30 seconds)**
```
Hi [First name], this is [Your name] from [Company].
I just sent you an email - wanted to make sure you got it.
Happy to chat whenever you're free!
```

**Why it works:**
- Email provides details; text ensures visibility
- Text feels personal and immediate
- Creates multiple touchpoints instantly
- 98% of texts are read within 3 minutes

### The Nine-Word Email (Smith)

The ultimate re-engagement tool for cold leads:

```
Subject: [First name]?

Hi [First name],

Are you still looking to [what you sell]?

[Your name]
```

**Examples:**
- "Are you still looking to sell your home?"
- "Are you still looking to grow your email list?"
- "Are you still looking to hire a developer?"

**Why it works:**
- Extreme brevity commands attention
- Question demands a response
- References their original intent
- No pressure, just curiosity
- Filters for still-interested prospects

**Expected results:**
- 10-20% response rate from "dead" leads
- Responses reveal updated timing and interest level
- Works even on leads 6-12+ months old

### The Drip Campaign Structure (Smith)

A strategic follow-up sequence that maintains contact without overwhelming:

| Timeframe | Purpose | Approach |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| **Day 1** | Immediate response | Speed-to-lead, Double Tap, establish contact |
| **Day 2-3** | Follow-up persistence | Value-add, different angle, new information |
| **Day 5-7** | Re-engagement attempt | Change medium, try phone if email failed |
| **Day 10-14** | Soft touch | Check-in, share relevant content |
| **Day 21-30** | Final push before nurture | Nine-word email, last active attempt |

**Day 1: Immediate Response**
```
Subject: Thanks for reaching out, [First name]

Hi [First name],

I just saw your inquiry come through and wanted to reach out right away.

I'd love to learn more about [what they asked about] and see if we can help.

Do you have 10 minutes for a quick call today or tomorrow?

[Your name]
[Phone number]
```

**Day 2-3: The Follow-Up**
```
Subject: Quick follow-up on [topic]

Hi [First name],

I wanted to follow up on my email from [day]. I know things get busy.

I came across [relevant resource/insight] and thought you might find it helpful
given your interest in [what they inquired about].

[Link or brief insight]

Still happy to chat whenever works for you.

[Your name]
```

**Day 5-7: The Value Add**
```
Subject: Thought you'd want to see this

[First name],

I was working with another [their role/industry] this week and they had a
question similar to yours about [topic].

Here's what we found works best: [brief actionable insight]

Would it help to walk through how this might apply to your situation?

[Your name]
```

**Day 10-14: The Soft Touch**
```
Subject: [First name], quick question

Hi [First name],

I want to be respectful of your time, so I'll keep this brief.

Are you still exploring options for [what they inquired about], or has the
timing changed?

Either way, no pressure - just want to make sure I'm being helpful, not annoying.

[Your name]
```

**Day 21-30: The Nine-Word (Final Active Attempt)**
```
Subject: [First name]?

Hi [First name],

Are you still looking to [what they originally inquired about]?

[Your name]
```

**After Day 30: Move to Long-Term Nurture**
- Monthly or bi-weekly value emails
- No direct sales asks
- Build relationship for future timing
- Re-activate with Nine-Word Email quarterly

### Behavior-Based Email Triggers (Smith)

The most effective emails respond to specific prospect behaviors, not just time elapsed:

**High-Intent Triggers (Respond Within 5 Minutes)**

| Behavior | Trigger Email |
|----------|---------------|
| Pricing page visit | "I noticed you were checking out our pricing..." |
| Demo request | Immediate confirmation + calendar link |
| Free trial signup | Welcome sequence with activation focus |
| Cart abandonment | Recovery email with objection handling |
| Downloaded lead magnet | Related offer or next-step content |

**Engagement Triggers (Respond Within 24 Hours)**

| Behavior | Trigger Email |
|----------|---------------|
| Opened email 3+ times | "I noticed you've been thinking about this..." |
| Clicked multiple links | Deeper dive on clicked topics |
| Visited website after email | Personalized follow-up on pages viewed |
| Forwarded email | "I saw you shared this - should I include [colleague name]?" |
| Replied but didn't convert | Address the specific hesitation |

**Re-Engagement Triggers**

| Behavior | Trigger Email |
|----------|---------------|
| 30 days inactive | Check-in email |
| 60 days inactive | Value-reminder + special offer |
| 90 days inactive | Nine-word email |
| Unsubscribe attempt | Preference center option before final removal |
| Email bounce | Try alternate channel (SMS, LinkedIn) |

**Setting Up Behavior Triggers:**

1. **Map the customer journey** - Identify key actions at each stage
2. **Assign intent scores** - High, medium, low intent behaviors
3. **Create response templates** - Pre-written for speed
4. **Set timing rules** - Faster response for higher intent
5. **Test and refine** - Track which triggers convert best

**Example: Pricing Page Trigger Email**
```
Subject: Quick question about [Product]

Hi [First name],

I noticed you were checking out our pricing page.

I'd love to help you figure out which option makes the most sense for
[their company/use case].

A lot of people have questions about [common concern] - happy to walk
you through it if that's helpful.

Do you have 10 minutes this week?

[Your name]
```

**Example: Cart Abandonment Trigger**
```
Subject: Did something go wrong?

Hi [First name],

I noticed you started signing up but didn't finish.

If something went wrong technically, I want to fix it.

If you have questions or concerns, I'm happy to answer them.

And if the timing just isn't right, no worries at all - I'll check back
in a few weeks.

Which is it?

[Your name]
```

## 4. Open/Click Optimization Techniques

### Message Matching

Mirror the language from wherever they came from:
- If they clicked a link promising "double your conversions," use that phrase in your email
- Match the call-to-action language that got them to subscribe
- Reduce "friction" by confirming they're in the right place

### The Scanning Strategy

People scan emails. Optimize for scanners:

1. **Headlines/Subject lines**: Stop readers in their tracks
2. **Subheads**: Hold attention, build on the main message
3. **Crossheads**: Centered, bolded statements that act as mini-headlines
4. **Bullets**: Benefit-focused, easy to scan

### Clarity Over Cleverness

**The ABC Rule**: Always Be Clear

If you have a choice between being clear and being clever, be clear. But a great analogy, simile, or metaphor can be both.

### Write for Motivation, Not Just Information

Your readers' real motivations run deeper than what they say:
- Getting incredible results with very little effort
- Feeling connected to other people
- Keeping up with the Joneses
- Attracting the person everyone else would want
- Finally getting respect
- Guaranteeing their family's financial well-being
- Loving what they see in the mirror

**You cannot create motivation in your email. You can only reflect the existing motivations of your readers.**

### Targeting Pain

Find out what keeps your customers up at night:
- Audit competitor emails to see what pain points they hit
- Monitor social media for pain mentions
- Survey your list directly

12-15 one-on-one interviews will generate about 80% of all possible pain points for your segment.

---

## 5. Amazon Review Mining Method

This technique finds the exact language your prospects use to describe their problems and desires.

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Identify related books** on topics similar to what you're selling:
   - If selling project management software, look at books on project management for beginners, advanced PM, PM for specific industries
   - If selling to parents, look at parenting books for relevant ages
   - If selling creative tools, look at books on creativity, productivity, the creative process

2. **Go through reviews one by one** looking for:
   - Memorable phrases
   - What people want
   - What people are mad about or in pain over
   - Unexpected benefits mentioned
   - Emotional language

3. **Document findings** in a simple table:

| Memorable Phrases | What People Want | What They're Mad About/In Pain Over |
|-------------------|------------------|-------------------------------------|
| [Quote from review] | [Desire mentioned] | [Pain point] |

4. **Look for swipe-worthy messages** that use literary techniques (see Section 6)

5. **Use verbatim or tweak** using copywriting techniques

### Example Success Story

For a rehabilitation center, Amazon review mining across 80 reviews on addiction and recovery books revealed this message:

> "If you think you need rehab, you do."

That became the winning headline, responsible for a 20%+ boost in leads - significant when each client was worth $20K/month.

### Additional Mining Sources

- App Store reviews (your own and competitors')
- Forum discussions
- Blog comments
- TripAdvisor/Yelp reviews
- Any user-generated content

### What to Look For

- **Frequency**: How often are people saying similar things? The more it comes up, the more it matters
- **Emotional language**: Strong feelings = strong copy opportunities
- **Specific phrases**: Look for ready-to-swipe statements
- **Objections and anxieties**: What worries them?
- **Unexpected benefits**: What surprised them positively?

---

## 6. Six Literary Techniques for Compelling Copy

Use these to identify swipe-worthy messages and to strengthen your own writing:

### 1. Repetition in Sets of 3 (Anaphora)

Things sound better when grouped in threes. Repeat the same word at the start of 3 sentences or clauses.

```
Example:
"See what they click. See where they scroll. See how to convert more."
```

### 2. Hyperbole + Similes

Exaggerations grab attention. Similes give frames of reference. Together, they create "word pictures" that stick in memory.

```
Example:
"It's like having a genius graphic designer on speed dial... for less than your coffee budget."
```

### 3. If-This-Then-That (IfTTT)

Phrases that cue logic resonate well because we make decisions emotionally but justify them with logic.

```
Examples:
"If you think you need rehab, you do."
"If you're tired of [pain], then [solution]."
```

### 4. Comparisons to What People Know

Introduce something new by framing it in context of something already known. Hollywood does this: "Jaws in space" = Aliens.

```
Examples:
"Think Slack meets project management"
"It's like Uber for dog walking"
```

### 5. Anthimeria

Generate rhetorical flair by making a word "behave" differently than grammar expects.

```
Examples:
"That's so fail."
"Because math."
"The future of awesome." (Xfinity)
"Think different." (Apple)
```

### 6. Living Sounds and Rhyming

Sound patterns stick in memory better than bland phrases.

**Living sounds**:
```
"Every time my phone buzzes with a new message, I feel a zing of joy"
```

**Subtle rhyming**: Studies show people believe rhyming phrases more accurately describe reality.

```
Example:
"Woes unite foes" is believed more than "Misfortunes unite foes"
```

### Identifying Swipe-Worthy Copy

When reviewing voice-of-customer data, look for phrases that:
- Use sets of three
- Create word pictures
- Have if-then logic
- Compare to known things
- Have natural rhythm or rhyme
- Use unexpected word forms

I noticed it's been a while since we've connected.

Rather than keep sending emails that might not be relevant anymore, I
wanted to check in and ask:

What would actually be helpful for you right now?

Reply with the number that fits best:

1 = I'm actively looking for [your solution] - let's talk
2 = I'm interested but not ready yet - send me occasional updates
3 = My situation has changed - please remove me from your list

No judgment either way. I just want to make sure I'm being helpful, not annoying.

**The "Last Chance" Before Removal**
```
Subject: Should I remove you from my list?

[First name],

I haven't heard from you in a while, and I don't want to keep cluttering
your inbox if you're no longer interested.

I'm going to remove inactive subscribers next week to make sure I'm only
emailing people who actually want to hear from me.

If you want to stay on the list, just click here: [Stay subscribed link]

If I don't hear from you, I'll take you off the list - no hard feelings.

Thanks for your time either way.

## 9. Key Messaging Principles

### Write for the Qualified Few

"If you try to make every visitor to your site happy, you'll end up saying nothing compelling."

- Target 20-35% of your list - the best-fit prospects
- Be specific enough that your ideal reader sees themselves
- Let others self-select out

### Specifics Stick

"A summary is not noticeable or memorable. Specifics stick."

Don't dilute messages to make them fit. Instead:
- Choose shorter, tighter words with greater impact
- Keep tangible details
- Use real numbers, real examples

### The Nana Rule

"If I learned that my sweet, wonderful nana had purchased something with this headline, would I worry she'd been ripped off?"

Use this to test if you've crossed from persuasive to manipulative.

### Features vs. Benefits

Always answer: "What value will my user/customer get out of using this?" (benefit)

Then answer: "What part of my product lets them get that value?" (feature)

Lead with benefits. Support with features.

### The Visualization Exercise

When writing, visualize 3 specific target customers standing together. Write to completely excite those 3 people. If you try to please 100 people, you'll dilute your message.
