## CTA Copy Formulas

### Letter Formulas for Closing

#### AIDA Formula
**Attention - Interest - Desire - Action**

The classic orderly process of a sale:
1. **Attention**: Grab attention with a headline or opening hook
2. **Interest**: Develop the reader's interest with compelling benefits
3. **Desire**: Build desire through proof, testimonials, and visualization
4. **Action**: Drive immediate response with a clear CTA

#### PAS Formula
**Problem - Agitate - Solution**

1. **Problem**: Identify the pain point or challenge
2. **Agitate**: Intensify the problem - make them feel it deeply
3. **Solution**: Present your offer as the relief

#### Star-Chain-Hook Formula

1. **Star**: Open with the most compelling benefit or promise (the "star" of your offer)
2. **Chain**: Build a logical chain of benefits, proof, and reasoning
3. **Hook**: Close with an irresistible call-to-action that hooks them into responding

### FBT Formula (Smith)
**Feature - Benefit - Tie-down**

Structure every selling point as a three-part statement:

1. **Feature**: State what the product/service has or does
2. **Benefit**: Explain why that matters to the prospect
3. **Tie-down**: End with a question that elicits agreement

**Template:**
```
[Feature] which means [Benefit], and that's important to you, isn't it?
```

**Examples:**
```
"Our software includes automatic backups, which means you'll never lose
important work again - and that peace of mind is important to you, isn't it?"

"This program comes with lifetime access, which means you can learn at
your own pace without rushing - that's what you're looking for, right?"

"We have a dedicated support team available 24/7, so you'll never be stuck
waiting for help when you need it most - and that matters to you, doesn't it?"
```

### Kennedy's CTA Test
"Imagine your letter being read by a guy in an apartment in Cleveland, in the midst of a ferocious winter storm, with gusting winds and snow outside at thigh height. You've got to get him so excited that he'll get out of the chair in front of the fireplace, bundle up, slog through the snow, go out to his cold car, and drive down to the post office to get a money order and a stamp."

### The Mañana Problem
The biggest group of non-respondents are those who intend to respond but set it aside for "later." Your CTA must overcome this inertia.

### CTA Element Framework

**1. Clear Action Verb:**
- Call now
- Order today
- Click here
- Reserve your spot
- Claim your [X]
- Get started

**2. Urgency Trigger:**
- Before [deadline]
- While supplies last
- Before this offer expires
- In the next [X] hours/days

**3. Benefit Reminder:**
- ...and start [experiencing benefit]
- ...to secure your [key benefit]
- ...and join [X] others who [achieved result]

### Softened Purchase Language (Veloso)

Replace hard-sell language with psychologically softer alternatives that reduce purchase resistance.

**Instead of "Buy Now":**
- Submit Your Online Reservation
- Unlock the Cash Vault
- Activate Your Membership
- Claim Your Access
- Reserve Your Spot
- Begin Your Journey
- Start Your Transformation
- Get Instant Access
- Complete Your Registration

**Instead of "Subscribe":**
- Join the Inner Circle
- Become a Member
- Get on the List
- Secure Your Place

**Instead of "Order":**
- Request Your Copy
- Claim Your Package
- Have It Sent to You
- Get It Delivered

**Why This Works:**
- Reduces the psychological "weight" of committing money
- Frames the action as receiving rather than spending
- Creates curiosity and exclusivity
- Makes the transaction feel like joining rather than buying

### Embedded Commands (Veloso)

Short, imperative phrases (3-7 words) embedded within longer sentences that bypass conscious resistance and speak directly to the subconscious.

**Technique:**
1. Use 3-7 word commands
2. Embed them naturally in flowing copy
3. The command should be a complete instruction
4. Can optionally emphasize with italics, bold, or different color

**Examples of Embedded Commands:**
- "Many people who *read this page* find themselves..."
- "As you *consider these benefits*, you'll notice..."
- "You might *feel excited* as you imagine..."
- "Most readers *take action immediately* because..."
- "When you *click the button below*, you'll..."
- "Smart business owners *get started today* because..."
- "Successful people *invest in themselves* and..."

**Command Templates:**
```
"I don't know if you should [command: buy this program], but I can tell you
that everyone who has [desired outcome]..."

"Before you [command: make your decision], let me share one more thing..."

"As you [command: think about your future], consider what it would mean to..."

"The reason I want you to [command: try this risk-free] is because..."
```

**Command Word Bank:**
- Get started now
- Take action today
- Make the decision
- Invest in yourself
- Click the button
- Claim your spot
- Begin your journey
- See for yourself
- Feel the difference
- Experience the results

### Involvement Devices (Veloso)

Interactive elements that increase engagement and psychological ownership before purchase.

**Types of Involvement Devices:**

**1. Check Boxes / Checklists:**
```
Check all that apply to you:
[ ] I want to earn more money
[ ] I'm ready to make a change
[ ] I've tried other solutions that didn't work
[ ] I'm committed to taking action
```

**2. Fill-in-the-Blank:**
```
In 90 days, I want to be earning $_______ per month.
My biggest challenge right now is _________________.
If I could change one thing about my [area], it would be _________________.
```

**3. Calculators / Estimators:**
```
"Enter your current [metric] below to see your potential results:
Current monthly revenue: $________
Potential increase (based on client average): 43%
Your projected monthly revenue: $________"
```

**4. Quizzes / Assessments:**
```
"Take our 60-second assessment to discover your [type/score/level]..."
"Answer these 5 questions to find out if [solution] is right for you..."
```

**5. Choose Your Path:**
```
"Which best describes you?
A) I'm just getting started and need the fundamentals
B) I have experience but want to accelerate results
C) I'm already successful and looking for advanced strategies"
```

**6. Commitment Statements:**
```
"By clicking below, I confirm that:
- I'm serious about [achieving result]
- I'm willing to put in the work
- I'm ready to invest in my success"
```

**Why Involvement Devices Work:**
- Creates psychological ownership before purchase
- Increases time on page (investment = commitment)
- Allows prospects to self-select and pre-qualify
- Generates micro-commitments that lead to the main commitment
- Provides personalized experience
- Triggers consistency principle (Cialdini)

### CTA Templates

**Direct Response:**
```
Call [number] right now to claim your [product/offer] before [deadline].
```

**Risk-Free Offer:**
```
Try [product] for [X] days completely risk-free. If you're not [achieving result],
simply return it for a full refund.
```

**Limited Availability:**
```
Only [X] spots remain. Reserve yours now before they're gone.
```

**Value Stack Close:**
```
You get [item 1] (worth $X), [item 2] (worth $X), and [item 3] (worth $X) -
a total value of $XXX - all for just $XX when you order by [deadline].
```

**Softened CTA (Veloso):**
```
Click the button below to submit your reservation and unlock immediate
access to [program]. Your spot is waiting.
```

**Embedded Command CTA:**
```
When you're ready to [command: take control of your future], simply
[command: click the button below] and you'll have instant access.
```

### The P.S. (Critical Close Element)

Every sales letter needs a P.S. - many readers skip to the end first.

#### P.S. Functions
1. Summarize the core offer or promise
2. Restate the deadline or urgency element
3. Add a final bonus or incentive
4. Serve as a "second headline" for skimmers

#### P.S. Templates

**Urgency P.S.:**
```
P.S. Remember, this offer expires at midnight on [date]. After that,
the price goes back to $XXX. Don't miss out.
```

**Bonus P.S.:**
```
P.S. Order by [date] and you'll also receive [bonus item] absolutely free -
a $XX value, yours to keep even if you decide to return [product].
```

**Guarantee Reminder P.S.:**
```
P.S. Don't forget - you're protected by our [X]-day money-back guarantee.
You risk nothing by trying [product] today.
```

**Scarcity P.S.:**
```
P.S. As of this morning, only [X] units remain. Once they're gone,
we won't have more for [timeframe]. Secure yours now.
```

**Combination P.S.:**
```
P.S. This is a test and is being offered to only a fraction of our
[customers/subscribers/members] and may never be offered again.
This offer is available only until [date], or until our allotted
[number/quantity] is gone, whichever comes first. I urge you to act quickly.
```

## Closing Techniques

### Five Yeses Technique (Smith)

Before presenting the pitch, get the prospect to confirm five things they've told you. This activates the consistency principle and creates momentum toward yes.

**How It Works:**
1. During discovery, note key things the prospect has shared
2. Before transitioning to the pitch, recap those items
3. Get verbal confirmation on each point
4. Build up to the natural conclusion: your solution

**Template:**
```
"Let me make sure I have this right...

1. You said you're currently [situation], correct?
2. And your main goal is to [desired outcome], right?
3. You mentioned that [pain point] is your biggest challenge, yes?
4. You told me you're looking for [specific feature/benefit], is that right?
5. And you said if you found the right solution, you're ready to [take action], correct?

Great. Based on everything you've shared with me, I think I have exactly
what you're looking for. Here's what I recommend..."
```

**Why It Works:**
- Each "yes" builds psychological momentum
- Demonstrates active listening and builds rapport
- Prospect talks themselves into the sale
- Creates consistency - hard to say no after five yeses
- Transitions naturally into the presentation

### "Here's What Happens Next" Transition (Smith)

A smooth, assumptive transition from presentation to close. Instead of asking "Would you like to buy?", assume the sale and explain the process.

**Template:**
```
"Based on everything we've discussed, here's what happens next:

Step 1: [Simple first action - filling out form, making payment, etc.]
Step 2: [What you do - send materials, schedule onboarding, etc.]
Step 3: [What they receive/experience - access, delivery, etc.]
Step 4: [The result - they start benefiting]

The whole process takes about [timeframe]. Should we get started?"
```

**Variations:**
```
"Here's how it works from here..."
"Let me walk you through the next steps..."
"Here's what the process looks like..."
"Here's how we'll get you started..."
```

**Why It Works:**
- Reduces uncertainty about what happens after they say yes
- Makes the purchase feel like a process rather than a decision
- Assumptive language bypasses the "should I buy?" question
- Provides clarity and reduces anxiety
- The final question is about timing, not whether

### Trial Close (Smith)

Test buying temperature throughout the conversation without pushing for commitment. Allows you to address concerns before asking for the sale.

**Trial Close Phrases:**
```
"Based on everything we've discussed, how are you feeling about this?"
"Does this sound like it could work for you?"
"Is this the kind of solution you've been looking for?"
"How does this compare to what you've seen elsewhere?"
"Can you see yourself using this?"
"Does this make sense for your situation?"
"What's your gut feeling so far?"
```

**Interpreting Responses:**

**Positive signals (proceed to close):**
- "This sounds great"
- "I think this could work"
- "Yes, this is what I need"
- Asking about details, pricing, timeline

**Neutral signals (more information needed):**
- "I'm not sure yet"
- "I need to think about it"
- "What about [specific question]?"

**Negative signals (address objections):**
- "I don't think so"
- "It's too expensive"
- "I've heard that before"

### Slot Close / Either-Or Close (Smith)

Instead of asking yes/no questions, offer two positive options. Either answer moves the sale forward.

**Templates:**
```
"Would Tuesday or Thursday work better for you?"
"Do you prefer the monthly plan or the annual plan?"
"Would you rather start this week or next?"
"Do you want to begin with the starter package or go with the complete system?"
"Should I send the materials to your home or office?"
"Would you prefer to pay in full or set up payments?"
```

**Why It Works:**
- Removes the "no" option from the equation
- Assumes the sale while giving prospect control
- Focuses on implementation rather than decision
- Creates forward momentum
- Works for both scheduling and closing

### Assumptive Close Variations

**The Order Form Close:**
```
"Let me just get a few details to set up your account..."
[Start filling out the form]
"What's the best email for your login information?"
```

**The Next Step Close:**
```
"Great, so the next step is to get you set up. I just need..."
```

**The Scheduling Close:**
```
"Perfect. Let's look at the calendar and find the best time to get started..."
```

**The Delivery Close:**
```
"Excellent. Should I send everything to the address you mentioned earlier,
or is there a better location?"
```

### Response Boosters

#### Premium/Bonus Offers
Add a valuable bonus for immediate response:
- "Free [bonus] when you order by [deadline]"
- The right premium can increase response by up to 50%

#### Ease of Response
Remove all friction:
- Multiple response channels (phone, web, mail)
- Prepaid response envelopes
- Simple order forms
- Clear pricing with no hidden costs
- Accept all payment methods

#### Sweepstakes/Contests
- Creates entry deadline urgency
- Adds excitement and perceived value
- "Enter to win [prize] when you respond by [deadline]"

## Objection Handling

### ARP Technique - For Resistance (Smith)
**Acknowledge - Respond - Pivot**

Use when prospect expresses hesitation or resistance but hasn't stated a clear objection.

**Framework:**
1. **Acknowledge**: Show you heard them and validate their concern
2. **Respond**: Provide relevant information or perspective
3. **Pivot**: Redirect to a different angle or benefit

**Template:**
```
ACKNOWLEDGE: "I completely understand your hesitation..."
RESPOND: "What I can tell you is [relevant information]..."
PIVOT: "But let me ask you this - [redirect question]..."
```

**Example:**
```
Prospect: "I've tried things like this before and they didn't work."

"I completely understand that concern, and honestly, that's exactly why
I think you should consider this. [Acknowledge]

What makes this different is [key differentiator] - we've designed it
specifically for people who've been frustrated by [previous solutions]. [Respond]

But let me ask you this - if this actually worked, and you could finally
[achieve result], would it be worth giving it a shot with our guarantee in place?" [Pivot]
```

### ARC Technique - For Objections (Smith)
**Acknowledge - Respond - Close**

Use when prospect states a specific objection. Instead of pivoting, address it directly and ask for the sale.

**Framework:**
1. **Acknowledge**: Validate the objection without agreeing with it
2. **Respond**: Address the objection with facts, logic, or reframing
3. **Close**: Immediately ask for the sale

**Template:**
```
ACKNOWLEDGE: "That's a fair concern, and I'm glad you brought it up..."
RESPOND: "Here's what I know to be true [address objection directly]..."
CLOSE: "So with that in mind, are you ready to move forward?"
```

### Common Objection Scripts (Smith)

#### "I need to talk to my spouse/partner"

**Poor response:** "Okay, talk to them and let me know."

**Effective response:**
```
"Of course, and I respect that you make important decisions together.
That tells me a lot about you. [Acknowledge]

Let me ask you this - if it were entirely up to you, would you move forward
with this? [Isolate the objection]

[If yes:] Great. So the question isn't whether this is right for you - it's
whether your spouse will agree. What concerns do you think they might have?
[Uncover the real objection]

I'll tell you what - let's get them on the phone right now so I can answer
any questions they have directly. That way you don't have to try to remember
everything I told you. What's the best number to reach them?"
```

**Alternative approach:**
```
"I totally understand. Most of my best clients are people who discuss big
decisions with their partners - it shows good judgment.

Here's what typically happens though: you leave here, you try to explain
everything we discussed, and naturally some details get lost. Then your
partner has questions you can't answer, and you end up right back where
you started.

What if we brought them into the conversation now? That way they hear
everything firsthand and can ask their own questions. Would that work?"
```

#### "I need to think about it"

**Poor response:** "Sure, take your time."

**Effective response:**
```
"Absolutely, and I wouldn't want you to make a decision you're not
comfortable with. [Acknowledge]

Help me understand - when you say you need to think about it, what
specifically are you uncertain about? [Clarify]

Is it whether this is the right solution for you?
Is it the investment?
Is it the timing?
Or is it something else?"

[Address whatever concern they reveal]
```

**Alternative:**
```
"I hear you. But in my experience, 'I need to think about it' usually
means one of two things: either there's a specific concern I haven't
addressed, or you're just not sure this is right for you.

Which is it for you? Because if there's something holding you back,
I'd rather address it now while I'm here to answer questions than
have you trying to figure it out alone."
```

**The "Thinking" Reframe:**
```
"What specifically do you need to think about? Because thinking usually
means weighing pros and cons - and the best time to do that is while
I'm here to answer any questions.

What would you need to see or hear right now to feel confident about
moving forward?"
```

#### "It's too expensive / I can't afford it"

**Poor response:** "I understand, maybe later when you have the money."

**First, isolate the objection:**
```
"I hear you on the investment. But let me ask - if money weren't an issue,
is this something you'd want to do?"

[If no:] "Okay, so it sounds like the price might not be the only concern.
What else is holding you back?"

[If yes:] Continue with price objection handling below.
```

**Then address:**
```
"I completely understand - it's a significant investment, and I respect
that you take that seriously. [Acknowledge]

Let me ask you this: what is it costing you to NOT solve this problem?

If you continue doing what you're doing, where will you be in 6 months?
A year?

The way I see it, there are two costs to consider: the cost of this program,
and the cost of staying where you are. Which one is really more expensive?"
```

**The "Afford" Reframe:**
```
"When you say you can't afford it, do you mean:
A) You literally don't have access to the funds, or
B) You're not sure it's worth the investment?

Because those are two very different things, and I want to make sure
I'm helping you think through the right question."
```

**Payment Option Close:**
```
"I understand budget is a concern. That's exactly why we offer [payment plan].

Instead of $X upfront, you'd be paying just $Y per [period].

That's about $Z per day - less than a [relatable comparison].

And you'd start seeing results right away, so the program often pays
for itself before you've even finished paying. Does that make this
more doable for you?"
```

#### "I've been burned before"

```
"I really appreciate you sharing that, and honestly, I hear that a lot.
There are unfortunately plenty of [bad experiences] out there. [Acknowledge]

But let me ask you - when that happened before, what went wrong specifically?
[Understand their experience]

[Listen, then address the specific concern with how you're different]

Here's what I can promise you: [specific differentiator]. And beyond that,
you're protected by our [guarantee]. So even if history repeated itself -
which I don't believe it will - you'd have a way out.

Given that protection, are you willing to give this a shot?"
```

#### "I need to do more research"

```
"That makes total sense - you should absolutely make an informed decision.
What specifically are you wanting to research? [Clarify]

Maybe I can help answer those questions right now, or point you to the
resources you need.

[Address their questions]

Now that we've covered that, do you have everything you need to make
a decision?"
```

### Objection Prevention Framework

**The best objection handling is objection prevention.** Address common concerns before they become objections.

**In your presentation:**
```
"Now, you might be wondering about [common concern]. Let me address that
upfront..."

"Some people ask me about [objection]. Here's what I tell them..."

"Before you ask, let me explain why [potential concern] isn't an issue..."
```

**Pre-emptive language:**
```
"I know what you're thinking - [objection]. And I completely get it.
Here's why that's actually not a concern..."

"If you're like most people I talk to, you might be thinking [objection].
Let me show you why that's different here..."
```

## Guarantee Language

### The Psychology of Guarantees

Based on Whitman's Secret #33: "Guarantees That Guarantee Higher Response"

- Buyers feel vulnerable when exchanging money for promises
- A strong guarantee reduces "pre-purchase stress"
- In the buyer's mind: **skepticism** vs. **desire to believe** - your guarantee tips the scale
- Longer guarantees result in FEWER returns (avoids "beat the clock" mentality)

**The Guarantee Principle:**
The longer and stronger your guarantee, the more confidence it conveys.

### Hormozi Guarantee Formula

**Template:**
```
"If you don't achieve [specific measurable result] in [specific timeframe],
we will [specific action/offer]."
```

**Elements:**
1. **Specific Result**: What they will achieve (measurable, concrete)
2. **Specific Timeframe**: When they will achieve it
3. **Specific Action**: What you will do if they don't

**Examples:**
```
"If you don't land 3 new clients in 30 days, we'll refund every penny
and give you an extra $500 for your trouble."

"If you don't lose 10 pounds in 6 weeks following our program, we'll
continue coaching you for free until you do."

"If your website doesn't generate at least 50 qualified leads in 90 days,
we'll rebuild it from scratch at no additional cost."

"If you don't see a 20% increase in conversion rates within 60 days,
you don't pay a dime."
```

### Guarantee Templates

**Basic Money-Back:**
```
100% Money-Back Guarantee
If you're not completely satisfied for any reason, simply return [product]
within [timeframe] for a full refund. No questions asked.
```

**Double Your Money Back:**
```
DOUBLE YOUR MONEY BACK
...if you don't say this [product] is [bold claim]. Try it risk-free.
If you don't agree, return [product] and we'll refund TWICE what you paid.
```

**Results-Based Guarantee (Hormozi-style):**
```
THE [X] GUARANTEE
If you don't [achieve specific outcome] within [timeframe], we'll [specific action].
That's how confident we are that this will work for you.
```

**Conditional Guarantee:**
```
Our [X]-Year Guarantee
We stand behind [product] with a full [X]-year guarantee. If [product] fails
to [perform as promised] during that time, we'll [replace it/refund you/fix it]
at no cost to you.
```

**Lifetime Guarantee:**
```
LIFETIME GUARANTEE
Use [product] for as long as you own it. If it ever fails to [perform],
we'll [replace/repair/refund] - for life.
```

**Unconditional Guarantee:**
```
THE "MOST FAIR" GUARANTEE
If you're not absolutely thrilled with [product/program] for any reason -
or no reason at all - just let us know within [timeframe] and we'll
refund every penny. You don't even have to give us a reason.
```

**Anti-Guarantee (for premium offers):**
```
NO REFUNDS
We don't offer refunds because this program isn't for everyone. It's for
serious [target audience] who are committed to [result]. If you're not
100% sure this is for you, please don't join. We only want people who
are ready to do the work.
```

### Guarantee Stacking

Combine multiple guarantees for maximum risk reversal:

```
TRIPLE PROTECTION GUARANTEE

1. 30-Day "Try It" Guarantee
   If you don't love [product] within the first 30 days, return it for
   a full refund. No questions asked.

2. Results Guarantee
   If you follow the program and don't achieve [specific result] within
   [timeframe], we'll continue working with you for free until you do.

3. Lifetime Quality Guarantee
   If [product] ever breaks or fails to perform, we'll replace it free of
   charge. For life.

You're completely protected, no matter what.
```

### Guarantee Presentation Tips
- Surround with a fancy certificate border
- Include a printed signature
- Feature it prominently (don't hide it!)
- Ask the provocative question: "Why Do Our Competitors Guarantee Their [Product] for Only 90 Days? Do they know something about their [product] that they're not telling you?"

## Urgency Techniques

### The Psychology of Scarcity (Cialdini)

"Opportunities seem more valuable when their availability is limited."

- People are more motivated by the thought of **losing something** than gaining something of equal value
- When free choice is limited or threatened, we desire things significantly more than previously
- Newly experienced scarcity is more powerful than constant scarcity

### Urgency Types (Hormozi)

**1. Cohort-Based Urgency**
Legitimate scarcity based on group enrollment periods:
```
"The next cohort starts January 15th. Enrollment closes January 10th
to give us time to onboard everyone properly."

"This is a live group program - we only run it twice a year.
The Spring class is filling up now."

"We limit each group to 20 people to ensure personalized attention.
12 spots are already taken."
```

**2. Seasonal Urgency**
Time-bound offers tied to calendar events:
```
"This is our annual Black Friday offer - the only time we discount this program."

"End-of-year pricing ends December 31st. New rates take effect January 1st."

"Summer enrollment special - only available through August."
```

**3. Pricing Urgency**
Price changes based on time or action:
```
"Early bird pricing ends Friday. Price goes up $200 after that."

"Founding member rate - only available to the first 50 who join."

"This price is locked in for life. When we raise prices (and we will),
your rate stays the same."
```

**4. Exploding Offer**
Offer that decreases in value over time:
```
"The bonus package is worth $3,000 - but it's only available for
the next 48 hours."

"Every day you wait, one bonus disappears from the offer:
Day 1: All 5 bonuses included
Day 2: 4 bonuses
Day 3: 3 bonuses
..."
```

**5. Rolling Urgency**
New reason for urgency each period:
```
"This month's bonus is [X]. Next month, it's something different.
If you want [X], now is the time."
```

### Limited-Number Tactics

**Templates:**
- "There aren't more than [X] left in stock. When they're gone, that's it."
- "This is one of only [X] remaining."
- "Production is backed up and there's no telling when we'll get more."
- "Only [X] spots available."

**Example phrases:**
- Supplies Are Strictly Limited
- Good Only for the First 50 Callers
- NO Rain Checks Will Be Issued
- Seating Is Limited to [X] Participants

### Deadline Tactics

**Hard Deadlines** (specific cut-off date):
- "Sale Ends August 21st"
- "Offer Expires May 15"
- "Price Guaranteed Only Until [Date]"
- "Call Before [Date]"

**Soft Deadlines** (quantity or availability based):
- "Quantities are Strictly Limited"
- "While Supplies Last"
- "First Come, First Served"
- "Limited Offer"

**Power Phrase (Cialdini):**
"Exclusive, limited engagement ends soon!" (invokes scarcity three times in five words)

### The "Lost Availability" Technique (Cialdini)
Present the product as nearly unavailable, then "find" one for the customer:
1. Approach with: "I see you're interested in this model. Unfortunately, I sold the last one not more than twenty minutes ago."
2. Let disappointment register
3. Offer to check if there might be one left
4. Return with good news and a sales contract

### Discounts for Fast Response / Penalties for Slow Response

**Tiered pricing template:**
```
ENROLL BY [EARLY DATE]: $149.00 per person
ENROLL BY [MIDDLE DATE]: $199.00 per person
AT THE DOOR (if available): $229.00 per person
```

**Deadline stacking:**
```
ORDER BY FRIDAY: Full bonus package + 20% off
ORDER BY NEXT FRIDAY: 20% off only
ORDER AFTER: Full price
```

## Post-Conversion

### Post-Sale Script (Smith)

Immediately after the sale, reinforce the decision to prevent buyer's remorse. This is critical for reducing refunds and cancellations.

**The Four Elements:**
1. **Congratulate**: Celebrate their decision
2. **Confirm**: Verify the benefits they'll receive
3. **Contextualize**: Put their investment in perspective
4. **Commit**: Get them to verbalize their commitment

**Post-Sale Script Template:**
```
"Congratulations! You've just made a great decision. [Congratulate]

Let me just confirm what you're getting: [list the key benefits].
You're going to love the results. [Confirm]

You know, most people in your situation never take action. They stay
stuck doing the same thing, getting the same results. But you're
different - you made the investment in yourself. That takes courage,
and it's going to pay off. [Contextualize]

Now, I want to make sure you get the most out of this. Can you commit
to [first action they need to take]? Great. And will you promise to
[second action]? Perfect. [Commit]

You're going to do amazing. I'll check in with you on [date] to see
how things are going."
```

**Buyer's Remorse Prevention:**
```
"Before we wrap up, I just want to remind you why you made this decision.
You told me that [their pain point] was costing you [their quantified
cost/frustration]. And now you've got a solution.

Over the next few days, you might have that moment where you wonder
'did I make the right decision?' That's completely normal. When that
happens, I want you to remember this conversation and remember why you
chose to take action.

And remember - you're protected by our [guarantee]. If it doesn't work
out, you're covered. But I'm confident you won't need it.

Do you have any questions before we get you started?"
```

### Welcome Sequence Elements

**Immediate Post-Purchase:**
1. Confirmation email with receipt
2. Welcome message with next steps
3. Access/delivery information
4. Quick win - something they can do/experience immediately

**Day 1-3:**
1. How to get started guide
2. Community welcome (if applicable)
3. First success milestone
4. Support options reminder

**Day 7:**
1. Check-in message
2. Testimonials from similar customers
3. Tips for getting more value
4. Guarantee reminder (reduces anxiety)

### Referral Request Timing

**Best time to ask for referrals:**
- Immediately after a successful result
- After they express satisfaction
- At natural milestone moments
- After they've become a "true believer"

**Referral Script:**
```
"I'm so glad this is working for you! I have a quick question -
who else do you know who's dealing with [problem you solve]?

I'm not asking you to sell anything - I just want to help more people
like you get these kinds of results. If you can think of 2-3 people
who might benefit, I'd love to reach out and see if I can help them too.

And as a thank you, [referral incentive]."
```

### Preventing Cancellations/Refunds

**Proactive outreach schedule:**
- Day 1: Welcome + first action
- Day 3: Check-in + quick win
- Day 7: Progress check + support offer
- Day 14: Results check + celebration
- Day 21: Milestone reminder
- Day 28: Value reinforcement

**Cancellation prevention script (when they ask to cancel):**
```
"I'm sorry to hear you're thinking about canceling. Before we do anything,
can you help me understand what's not working for you?

[Listen to their concern]

I really appreciate you sharing that. [Acknowledge]

Here's what I'd like to propose - instead of canceling right now, what
if we [offer solution/additional help/extended timeline]? That way you
can [get the result they wanted] without losing the progress you've
already made.

Would you be willing to try that before making a final decision?"
```

**Save offers (in order of value):**
1. Additional support/coaching
2. Extended timeline
3. Pause membership (instead of cancel)
4. Downgrade to lower tier
5. Partial refund to keep them engaged
6. Full refund (last resort, preserve relationship)
