# Brand Kit Skill

## Overview

The Brand Kit skill is an orchestration layer that combines copywriting and design capabilities to create complete brand identities. Unlike individual `/copy` or `/design` skills that handle specific deliverables, Brand Kit manages the full spectrum of brand creation—from strategic foundation through visual identity to voice guidelines—producing a cohesive, professional brand guidelines document.

## When to Use Brand Kit

**Use Brand Kit when:**
- Creating a new brand from scratch
- Rebranding an existing company or product
- Developing a sub-brand or product line identity
- Building a comprehensive brand guidelines document
- Need strategic alignment across all brand elements

**Use individual skills instead when:**
- `/copy` — Writing specific content (ads, landing pages, emails) for an established brand
- `/design` — Creating individual visual assets with existing brand guidelines
- Working on a single deliverable rather than full identity

## Brand Kit Workflow

### Phase 1: Brand Strategy Foundation

Before any creative work begins, establish the strategic pillars:

**Positioning**
- Market category and competitive frame
- Unique value proposition
- Key differentiators
- Target positioning statement

**Brand Values**
- Core values (3-5 principles)
- Value hierarchy and prioritization
- How values manifest in behavior

**Brand Personality**
- Personality archetype selection
- Trait spectrum definitions
- Personality do's and don'ts

**Audience Definition**
- Primary and secondary audiences
- Demographic and psychographic profiles
- Pain points and aspirations
- Decision-making criteria

### Phase 2: Naming (If Required)

When brand naming is needed:

**Naming Strategy**
- Naming criteria and constraints
- Competitive naming landscape
- Linguistic and cultural considerations
- Domain and trademark preliminary checks

**Name Development**
- Name candidates by category (descriptive, invented, metaphorical, etc.)
- Name evaluation against criteria
- Shortlist with rationale
- Final recommendation

### Phase 3: Visual Identity

Create the visual brand system:

**Logo Design**
- Primary logo concept and rationale
- Logo variations (horizontal, stacked, icon-only)
- Clear space and minimum size requirements
- Logo misuse examples

**Color Palette**
- Primary brand colors with hex/RGB/CMYK values
- Secondary and accent colors
- Color usage hierarchy
- Color accessibility considerations

**Typography**
- Primary typeface for headlines
- Secondary typeface for body text
- Type hierarchy and scale
- Web and print specifications

**Visual Elements**
- Photography style direction
- Iconography approach
- Pattern or texture systems
- Layout principles

### Phase 4: Brand Voice

Define how the brand communicates:

**Tone of Voice**
- Voice characteristics (3-4 defining traits)
- Tone spectrum by context
- Voice do's and don'ts
- Before/after examples

**Messaging Guidelines**
- Key messages by audience
- Tagline and supporting statements
- Boilerplate copy
- Message hierarchy

**Writing Standards**
- Grammar and style preferences
- Terminology and vocabulary
- Inclusive language guidelines
- Channel-specific adaptations

### Phase 5: Brand Guidelines Document

Compile all elements into a comprehensive deliverable:

**Document Structure**
1. Brand Story and Purpose
2. Strategy Overview
3. Visual Identity System
4. Voice and Tone Guidelines
5. Application Examples
6. Asset Specifications

## Cross-Skill References

## Orchestration Principles

1. **Sequential Dependencies** — Strategy must precede creative execution; visual and verbal identities should develop in parallel
2. **Cohesion Checks** — Continuously validate that all elements reinforce the strategic foundation
3. **Iteration Points** — Build in review gates between phases for stakeholder alignment
4. **Flexibility** — Adapt the workflow depth based on project scope (startup MVP vs. enterprise rebrand)
5. **Documentation** — Capture rationale alongside deliverables for future reference

## Quality Standards

A complete brand kit should:
- Demonstrate clear strategic logic from foundation to execution
- Present a distinctive and ownable visual identity
- Articulate a consistent and authentic voice
- Provide practical guidance for implementation
- Scale across all anticipated touchpoints
- Balance aspiration with actionability
